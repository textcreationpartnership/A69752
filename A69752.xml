            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AFter theſe dark and dreadfull dayes of barbarous blindneſſe, &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, wherein, by the deceit of dumb dogs, bloudie warres for many years had covered the face of this land, it pleaſed the bountifulneſſe of God, in that riches of his love, as not regarding the time of former ignorance, with a marvellous mercy to viſit this Realme, by ſending, not one <hi>Jonah</hi> to ſuch a Ninivie, or one <hi>Phillip</hi> to ſuch a Samaria, but firſt few, ſince many, and all faithfull, holy, wiſe, frack to preach the Goſpel in Scotland, as in another Antiochia. At the terrour of theſe Trumpets, like ſmoake before the winde, were quickly driven away, not onely the darkeneſſe of Idolatrie, and damnable diſſenſion among the members of this kingdom, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the ſtrength of that bloudie beaſt, by whoſe tyrannous crueltie, and deceivable wayes, Princes and People, were ſhamefully abuſed, and often compelled with the clawes of violence to ſhed the bloud of the Saints; yea, to keep the booke of the unchangeable Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt, under the cover of a ſtrange tongue, as a claſped boeke that it ſhould not be read: but alſo, many of that Antichriſtian ſect, who in the time of perſecution had uſed the curious Arts of that kingdom of lies, and ſervice of <hi>Baal,</hi> were turned to the truth of God, and preached the word of his grace, ſo that in a ſhort time that Romiſh <hi>Jericho</hi> fell, the people that ſate in darkneſſe ſaw a great light, and where the power of Satan had prevailed, the Throne of Chriſt was ſet up, the word increaſed, and the Lord added to the Kirke from day to day, ſuch as were to be ſaved; ſo magnifying the ſtrength of his owne arme againſt his enemies, in that proſperous time, that neither proud Anakims, nor craftie Gibeonites, were able to ſtand before the Spirit that ſpake in theſe men of God, when they were but few: and though they walked in the fleſh, yet did they not warre after the fleſh, but by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall armes of bold Preaching, reverent miniſtration of the Sacraments, and ſincere ruling of the flocke of Chriſt with diſcretion, and without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie, and alwayes praying, and often faſting, they baniſhed Atheiſme, Barbaritie, and Papiſtrie, quenched the fire of contentions, prevented dangers, planted the Kirkes, teached and perſwaded great and ſmall, poore and rich, and perſons of all eſtates, to profeſſe the Evangel. And howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were daily croſſed with deceit, and oppoſition, ſo led they diverſity
<pb facs="tcp:95701:3"/>in the hand of amitie, that all things concerning the great worke of that glorious reformation, to the praiſe of God, and the comfort of the godly, were wiſely and firmly appointed. In thoſe happy dayes the ſervants of the Lord, in love were like <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> in courage like Gideons <hi>300.</hi> in unitie like the Saints that firſt received the Goſpel; in care and diligence like the builders of the wall of Jeruſalem, and ſo marching like the Lords Armies. Then were they neither deſpiſed nor abhorred but received as the Angels of God; and yet in the Lords troupes, neither for worke, nor war, were there to be found any pompous Prelate, Abbot, Prior, Biſhop, or Archbiſhop, that loves to ſhine in dignitie, and rejoyce in rent, with the contempt of their brethren, and neglect of the Lords ſervice. O Scotland! what was then thy felicitie? Then didſt thou ſing &amp; ſhout with the voyce of joy: <hi>God will ariſe, and his enemies ſhall be ſcattered; they alſo that hate him ſhall ſtye before him. Thou haſt brought a Vine out of Egypt. Thou haſt caſt out the heathen, and planted it. Thou madeſt roome for it, and didſt cauſe it to take root, and it filled the land, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſuperſtitious ignorant, the perverſe Papiſt the craftie Paraſite, and the ſelf-loving Politian, the Chriſtian coloured Belly-god, and the looſe-liver, the time-ſerver, and all the ſorts of that filthy ſect, that hates to bee reformed, often conſpired againſt the building of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Temple, but all in vaine; for by the power of God they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Yet in theſe laſt dayes ſome dangerous <hi>Dalilah</hi> hath betrayed <hi>Sampſon;</hi> and told wherein his ſtrength lay, with no leſſe hurt to this Kirke, then was performed by the falſe brethren, who were craftily ſent in, and crept in privily amongſt the faithfull, to ſpie out their liberty which they had in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring them into bondage. It is cleerly knowne to many in this Kingdome, and in forraine parts, what a wall for defence, and a band for peace, and progreſſe of the Goſpel, was that heavenly diſcipline, whereby brotherly amitie, and ſacred harmonie of Prince, Paſtors and Profeſſours, were ſo continued and increaſed that all, as one man, did stand together for the Doctrine, Sacraments, and Kirke government, againſt the adverſaries, either lurking or profeſſed. It was the hedge of the Lords vineyard, and the hammer whereby the hornes both of adverſaries, and diſobeyers, were beaten and broken. And of this happy mean it might be truely ſaid, that in the ſtrength of it, more then by our owne vertue, were we ſtrong and prevailed: And to ſharpen our love it is thus written by a stranger, but a friend. <hi>Albeit it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that they who have their Citie in heaven, repoſe altogether thereupon, yet nothing ſhould let us to behold, as it were, heaven
<pb facs="tcp:95701:3"/>upon earth, that is, the power of God in his owne, &amp;c. By moſt evident reaſons I judge the Kirke of Scotland to be of this ſort; In the which, the many mightie, and long continuing aſſaults of Satan, the like whereof, as I thinke, no Nation ſuſtained, could neither defile the puritie of doctrine, nor bow the rule of right diſcipline. This is a great gift of God, that he hath brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Scotland, both the puritie of Religion, and Diſcipline, whereby, as in a bond, the doctrine is ſafely kept. I pray and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſo to keep theſe two together, as that ye may be aſſured, that if the one fall, the other can no wayes long ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, but by the ſpace of fifty yeares and above, Scotland ranne well, the Doctrine was in ſuch ſort preached, and Diſcipline ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and practiſed; yea, both profeſſed, eſtabliſhed, and conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; not onely by thoſe faithfull men that went before, but by them who followed, and yet live, in ſuch concord of Kirk and policie, that the like thereof is ſcarcely to be found in Storie, or ſeene with eyes in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince the revelation of the Myſterie of the Goſpel to the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. But now of late, with pitie of ſpeake it, no uncircumciſed Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim, or Aſſyrian, but ſome of the Diſciples, deſirous to ſit at the right hand, and pretending to reſtore againe the Kingdome to Iſrael, the Kirke to her old rents, and priviledges, at first did mince and ſparingly ſpeake, but afterward practiſe and loudly preach; that, except after the manner of other Nations, the Kirke of Scotland admitted againe Prelates, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that wicked Hierarchie, with ſome untruſty traditions, and change of things indifferent, as they terme them, but in effect the diſgracing of Paſtors, ejecting of Elders, deſtroying of Aſſemblies, and Faſhioning, Doctrine, Diſcipline, Sacraments, Confeſſions of Faith, Formes of prayer, and all in a new ſhape; it cannot be ſaved, nor vindicate from povertie and contempt, but by the meanes of this maladie obtruded for a remedie. Not onely theſe evils, howſoever at the beginning ſeeming ſmall, hath ſo growne, that like nettles in a fowle ground, they not onely bud and bloome; but abundantly bring forth diviſions; diſſenſions, and unkindly contentions among brethren, to the great joy of the enemies, and griefe and offence of them that feare God. This ſtrange fire hath entred into the Citie of God, and horriblie burnes on: and yet is it ſo, that ſuch as may, will not, and ſuch as are willing, cannot, and they that ſhould be firſt, are leaſt zealous and forward to offer their paines, either to cleare and defend the truth, to paciſie their brethren, or to pleade the cauſe of Diſcipline against the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and cavillations of ſuch as by promoting of novelties, ſeekes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; but uncharitable ſpeeches, and peſtiferous pennes of diſſenſion,
<pb facs="tcp:95701:4"/>fretting as a canker, increaſeth unto more ungedlineſſe; dangerous diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, the daughter of diviſion, and the undoubted fore-runner of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation daily proclaimes the defacing, if not the fall of this reformed Kirk.</p>
            <p>As if no care ſhould be taken that the Spouſe of Jeſus Christ; who ſo long like a chaſte Virgin hath ſhined in purity before her Lord in this land, ſhould now be ſtained with <hi>Corahs</hi> ambition, <hi>Balaams</hi> wages, and <hi>Eſau</hi>'s profaneneſſe, Altar againſt Altar, and Brother againſt Brother. In this caſe, ſo pitifull, and good cauſe ſo univerſally neglected, if not deſerted; it ſhould be our hearts deſire, and prayer to God to be found faithfull, when with griefe we may justly ſay of the old friends, and new adverſaries of Diſcipline. <hi>It is time for the Lord to worke, for they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy Laws:</hi> And of her conſtant friends boldly avow, <hi>Therefore love they thy commandements above gold, yea above moſt fine gold.</hi> Could this pragmaticall courſe of dangerous deſertion from a truth ſo long profeſſed, whereof none, or few can be ignorant, worke in our hearts, now almoſt luke-warme, a laborious love, and holy zeale for that truth whereof we are perſwaded, we might then be fully aſſured, That as it was ſaid in the booke of the warres of the Lord, what he did in the red ſea, and in the brooks of Arnon, the banners of his power being diſplayed for Iſrael, as well at their entrie into Canaan againſt the Nations, as at their comming out of Egypt againſt Pharaoh: ſo through the wonderfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his equivalent power, and unchangeable love, it ſhould be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in the Records of the reformed Kirkes of Scotland, that what he did firſt in ſubſtance, that he did laſt in ceremonie, making the end of his own worke againſt Apoſtates from Diſcipline, profeſſed by themſelves, and in that reſpect renters of brotherly unitie, and dividers of brethren, anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the happy beginnings thereof againſt cruell perſecutors, and wicked Hereticks. Is the Lord changed, becauſe he changes the manner of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? God forbid. For although hee declare not in out times who belong to him by miraculous fire ſent from heaven, as in the dayes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> the earth opens not her mouth, as in the dayes of <hi>Corah;</hi> he raines not ſhowers of Brimſtone upon the Sodomites of this age he turns not ſuch as looke backe into pillars of ſalt to ſeaſon others, neither is his favour manifeſted towards his owne ſecret ones, in earthly &amp; viſible bleſſings, ſo wonderfully as of old; yet the God of Iſrael is our God, &amp; the God of the old Teſtament is the God of the New, &amp; better Teſtament, having ſtill a ſecret &amp; equivalent provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence moſt wiſely diſpoſed, &amp; framed for the weale of his Kirk according to the diverſitie of the ages ſucceeding one after another. So that no wiſe heart perceiving the courſe thereof could wiſh another then the preſent, howſoever the follie of Infidelitie blindes men to affect the miracles, caſe, and outward
<pb facs="tcp:95701:4"/>ſperitie of former generations, and if theſe faile, to caſt themſelves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in deſperation, defection, or Atheiſme. Yea, becauſe hee workes not as before, in their haſte, they conclude, that he workes not at all. It were our wiſedome, who live in the laſt times, rather to determine with our ſelves, that as in great and extraordinarie plagues, ſmall and common diſeaſes are ſwallowed up; ſo will the Lord, leaving all other warnings, have all eares to be lift up in feare, to the hearing of the loud Trumpet of the Goſpel, ſummoning all fleſh before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that they may most of all tremble at that laſt ſentence, which debarres men for ever from the face of God, and in the meane time, will have the life of his owne children hid with Chriſt, that in a holy conformitie with him, they may by many afflictions enter into his Kingdome. As the preſent proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the common ſort doth make their feare the greater; ſo the croſſes of the Kirke ſhould make them with the greater courage to lift up their heads, and while the day of their redemption drawes neer, to walk with the greater fidelitie in their vocations, building the houſe of God with the one hand, &amp; fighting with the other, againſt enemies of all ſorts, eſpecially theſe Sanballats, and Tobiahs, who labour to make other Kirkes abroad, and a great number of the Paſtors and People at home, to thinke that a great part of the walls of Chriſts Kirke, builded within this Nation, ſince our deliverie from the Romiſh captivitie, are ſo weake, that if a Fox ſhall goe up upon them, he ſhould breake them downe. And now forſooth the new worke riſing in place of the old to be more firme, and of the old foundation, when the myſterie of iniquitie, after long working in ſecret was ſeen mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, there was a new face brought upon the Kirke. The pure fountaines of holy Scripture troubled with the puddle of trifling traditions, ceremonies brought in, and will-worſhip, and damnable Idolatrie ſet up, Apoſtolicall Diſcipline aboliſhed, and Popiſh policie exalted. Yet ſuch is the wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, knowing the weakeneſſe of errour, and force of the truth, that multitudes in the ſucceeding times have not bluſht to bring in theſe novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under the name of anoient verities; yea, without ſhame, or feare, to affirme that this laſt was the primitive and naturall face of their mother. It may be ſeene in theſe dayes, that after a large time, this ſecond myſterie working under cover, yet alwayes perceived by ſome in this Land, is now at laſt brought to light, according to the warnings of the wiſe watchmen of this Kirke, and hath changed the comely countenance of Chriſts Spouſe, further then the lovers of the truth would have thought, into the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian complexion of that whore of Babel, and without Gods preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mercie, and our ſpeedy repentance, the loſſe of a great ſubſtance for a foule conformitie; and yet, howſoever all men cry, that the ancient way
<pb facs="tcp:95701:5"/>was the beſt, and as they love honeſtie, they will be the ſonnes of conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and firmely retaine the ancient Diſcipline of the reformed Kirke of Scotland. They have renounced nothing, they have abjured nothing; yea, if any whiſper of a fall from the first love, they are quickly marked, as wilfull pleading for ſhadowes, and making of ſchiſmes: and ſo ſuch as would ſtrive to stand, muſt ſuffer for their fault, who hath wrought the change. As that old Painter, intending to repreſent the body of Hercules, expreſſed nothing of the lineaments of his face, ſtature, or members, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelfe with the reſemblance of the Lyons skinne, which hee was wont to carrie, as the badge of his ſtrength, and Trophie of his honour: So ſome of his Prentices, for the beautifull face of this Kirke, and heavenly proportion of her drivine Diſcipline, do ſet before the eyes of men of this time, who never ſaw the faire face, nor felt the ſtrength of ancient order, that roaring Lyons skinne of Epiſcopacie, the greatest monſter that this Kirke had conflicted with, in the moſt part of her meetings, and whoſe skin within theſe few yeares was commonly repute amongſt the rest of the ſpoyles taken from her enemies. As it was the courage of wiſe <hi>Cato</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bragges of arrogant Greekes, perverting all veritie and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of Hyſtorie, and uſurping the honour of the invention of all things, to write a booke <hi>de Originibus,</hi> for vindicating the truth from uſurping preſumption: And as in later times many have happily labored in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Roman inventions, and bringing to light the beginnings and progreſſe of errour and idolatrie, creeping in and corrupting that Kirke; It were likewiſe to be wiſhed, for the weale of this Kirke, and her cauſe of controverſies, that the Acts of the generall Aſſemblies, ſo often viſited and prepared for publicke uſe, were now according to the intention and care of the Kirke, together with the bookes of Diſcipline, which ſhould be lights for direction, and lawes for diciſion of controverſies ariſing thereabout, faithfully peruſed and printed.</p>
            <p>For the preſent neceſſitie, ye have here the firſt and ſecond bookes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, with certaine Acts of the Kirke for clearing your doubts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the truth againſt ſuch, as delight in vatles of obſcuritie, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits of circumvention. As there was never any miracle wrought for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing of Atheiſts becauſe every work of God is a miracle againſt them; ſo there needs no argument, to ſtop the mouthes of adverſaries for Diſcipline, who would ſeem to stand to their own oath and ancient profeſsion, becauſe every line almoſt of theſe bookes, will be an argument againſt them. If truth ſhall obtrude her ſelfe to the knowledge of men, not ſuffering them to be ſo forgetfull and ignorant, as perhaps they would ſeeme, God forbid that any ſhould thinke that his reſolution to be rich and ſtately, ſhould ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb facs="tcp:95701:5"/>his light, and ſtay his mind from thinking that true, which wee would wiſh were falſe, that were the ſinne of a wittie malignant: <hi>Haec eſt ſumma delicti nolle agnoſcere quod ignorare non potes:</hi> It were much better, that as many as through ignorance of the eſtabliſhed order in the Kirke have beene miſled, would now repent their negligence and dangerous courſe, when they ſhall ſee a good daughter of an evill mother. This truth brought to light to be the fruit of our diviſion, As perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in former times hath brought forth purity, and hereſie the truth of doctrine; ſo hath this fit of diſtraction among brethren brought this draught of Diſcipline to the view of the world; to ſo many as have ſtood, by the grace of God, to the defence of their profeſſion, a ſtrong confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to ſuch as are toſſed with doubtings, a cleere reſolution. Let it be no derogation to the truth here expreſſed, nor to the labours of theſe faithfull Fathers, who penned and put in Regiſter the ſame, but a great imputation and guiltineſſe lying upon the ſucceeding age, who deprived themſelves of ſuch a benefit, and the Kirk of ſuch a defence. Though the booke of Gods covenant lay long hid in the Temple, yet Joſiah rejoyced when it came to light. Very Jezabel could not be ſtayed from magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Baal by all the daſhes hee ſuffered from heaven and earth: And ſhould not Chriſtians be aſhamed to be leſſe affectionate to Veritie, then ſhe to Idolatrie, and namely a truth concerning Chriſts Kingly Office, and the Miniſters of his Kingdome; without the truth whereof we can neither have comfort of his Prophecie nor Prieſthood. It is the Lord his great mercy, that in the reformation of this Kirk he hath beene preached, and profeſſed, King, Prieſt, and Prophet. And it ſhall be the glory of this Land thankefully to acknowledge that incomprehenſible benefit, and alwayes carefully to keepe whole without rent, and to carrie a reverent eſtimation to the great worke of the glorious reformation of this Kirke. For this effect ye muſt arme your ſelves againſt the Lords of tongues, who have ſaid, <hi>with our tongues will we prevaile.</hi> Of that generation ſome will daſh you by the name odious of Puritan, &amp; yet one of that Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſort is forced to confeſſe, that Scots Profeſſours are unto him Puritanes from the forme of externall government, but not from Religion, which both is and may be one and the ſame, where the externall forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is different and contrary; who albeit they be miſerably taken with that their owne forme, yet in the reſt of the doctrine they are ſufficiently Orthodox. Others, like wicked creditors deſtroying the obligation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are bound for debtfull obedience, ſummarily deny, that ever this Kirk had any approved diſcipline, except that which is printed and placed in the Pſalme bookes. A third ſort, making ſuch Paſtors, who at the
<pb facs="tcp:95701:6"/>beginning were called Super-intendents, to be figures, patterns, forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or lievtenants of Biſhops, ſuch as now are, would move the world to beleeve that they follow the firſt Diſcipline. A fourth kinde, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the wilderneſſe of unbounded indifferency, takes upon them to determine all doubts of diſcipline, by honour, eaſe, or gaine. And ſome, of Gallio's diſpoſition it may be, hidly eſteeming all Religion a matter of ſpeech, ſpare not to proclaime, that ſtriving about ſuch trifles is needleſſe. For your incouragement againſt ſuch, and others of the like diſpoſition, it hath pleaſed the Lord to ſet on worke our pens; and in his owne time, if preſumption bee obſtinate, hee will inſpire them with greater love of his truth, to whom he hath given knowledge in meaſure above them who hath put to their hand; and increaſe their knowledge, in whoſe hearts he hath wrought ſome love, howſoever their knowledge be far inferiour to many of theirs who stand for the truth.</p>
            <p>It is to be remembred, that the true friends of diſcipline are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the bleſſed Evangel of Jeſus Chriſt, agreeing in doctrine, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the people of this Realme that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt, as he is now offered in his Evangel, and doe communicate with the holy Sacraments (as in the reformed Kirke of this Realme they are publickly adminiſtred) according to the confeſſion of Faith; and that ſuch as were clothed with the Kirkrents, or greedily gaped after the ſame, as Abbots, Priors, Prioreſſes, Biſhops, Commendatairs, and other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious uſurpers of Kirk-livings, as they had place in policie, and credit in Court, or Councell, either profeſſedly or craftily, have reſiſted the courſe of the Goſpel, and the diſcipline thereof, as may be ſeen in theſe conflicts, whereby the Kirke hath ever ſtriven for deliverance from their uſurpation; till now the zeale of benefices having devoured the zeale of diſcipline, old oppoſites are thought to be her most loving familiars, and her old friends her greateſt enemies. A ſtrange Caſe, and yet very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall for the Kirk by ſeeking worldly preferment, to loſe ſpirituall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as one ſaid, <hi>Never a Miniſter got a great Benefice, but hee ſpilt it, or it ſpilt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> that under the name of diſcipline is to be understood not onely the particulars expreſſed in theſe two bookes, but alſo the Acts, Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and practiſes agreed upon, and recorded in the Regiſters of the Generall and Provinciall Aſſemblies, Presbyteries, and Kirk Seſsions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to conſider the different conditions of the Kirk in her infancie, in her growing, and in her ripe age, and accordingly to accommodate the diſcipline to practiſe, as the condition of the time permitted or required,
<pb facs="tcp:95701:6"/>and wiſely to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Kirks purpoſe and intention in every particular, and their poſſibility to performe and practiſe, as circumſtances concurred, or were contrary: As for example, they intended reſident Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, one or moe, as Kirks were of largeneſſe, with Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. <hi>Item,</hi> Doctors of Divinitie for Schools, Aſſemblies generall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, weekely meetings for the interpretation of the Scripture, which afterward at Edinburgh the <hi>7.</hi> day of July, <hi>1579.</hi> were judged to be a Presbyterie: And they abhorred Anarchie, Oligarchie, and Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie: but with great paines and frequent meetings was abuſes condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and order eſtabliſhed; ſo that for lack of ordinary Miniſters planted, &amp; in that reſpect lack of lawfull Aſſemblies, they were forced occaſionally to uſe Super-intendents, and Viſiters of Countries, who afterward in the generall Aſſemblie holden at Edinburgh the <hi>4.</hi> of Auguſt <hi>1590.</hi> when Presbyters were well and orderly conſtitute, were declared neither to be neceſſary, nor expedient.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the firſt and ſecond booke of Diſcipline, penned by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the reformed Kirke, and the firſt booke at the charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the great Councell of Scotland, ſubſcribed by the greateſt part thereof, and afterward by many more, as may be ſeene in the Acts of the Kirk: the ſecond booke ſtanding inſert in publick Regiſter of the Kirk, ordained to be ſubſcribed by divers Acts of the Aſſemblie, and confirmed by practiſe, are both for one end: To wit, to direct reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Doctrine, Sacraments, and exerciſe of Diſcipline, and to reſiſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and corruptions. The firſt hath more particular purpoſes: The ſecond ſets down more fully, and particularly the juriſdiction of the Kirk as it agrees, or is diſtinguiſhed from the Civill Policie, the Office-bearers of the Kirk with their dutie, the Aſſemblies of the Kirk, and diſtinctions thereof; the Patrimony of the Kirk, and diſtribution thereof; the Office of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate in the Kirk; certaine heads of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, with the utility of the ſaid bookes, &amp;c. <hi>Item,</hi> either of the ſaid bookes confirme the other, and neither of them aboliſh, or innovate the other.</p>

               <p>LEſt that upon this generality ungodly men take occaſion to cavill, this wee adde for explication: By preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell wee underſtand not onely the Scriptures of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo of the old, to wit, the Law, Prophets, and Hiſtories, in which Chriſt Jeſus is no leſſe contained in figure, then wee have him now expreſſed in verity And therefore with the Apoſtle we affirme, that all Scripture inſpired of God is profitable to in ſtruct, to reprove, and to exhort. In which bookes of old and new Teſtaments, we affirme that all thing neceſſary for the inſtruction of the Church, and to make the man of God perfect, is contained and ſufficiently expreſſed.</p>
               <p>By the contrary doctrine wee underſtand whatſoever men by lawes, counſells, or conſtitutions, have impoſed upon the conſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, without the expreſſed commandement of Gods word, ſuch as bee the vowes of chaſtity, for ſwearing of marriage, binding of men and women to ſeverall and diſguiſed apparells, to the ſuperſtitious obſervation of faſting dayes, difference of meat for conſcience ſake, prayer for the dead, and keeping of holy dayes of certaine Saints commanded by man, ſuch as bee all thoſe that the Papiſts have invented, as the feaſts (as they terme them) of the Apoſtles, Martyrs, Virgines, of Chriſtmaſſe, Circumciſion, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanie,

               <head>The ſecond head of Sacraments.</head>
               <p>TO Chriſt Jeſus his holy Goſpell truly preached, of neceſſity it is, that his holy Sacraments bee annexed, and truely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, as ſeales and viſible confirmations of the ſpirituall promiſes contained in the word; and they bee two, to wit, Baptiſme, and the holy Supper of the Lord Ieſus, which are then rightly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, when by a lawfull Miniſter the people, before the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, are plainely inſtructed, and put in mind of Gods free grace and mercy, offered unto the penitent in Chriſt Jeſus: when Gods promiſes are rehearſed, the end and uſe of Sacraments preached and declared, and that in ſuch a tongue as the people doe underſtand: when farther to them is nothing added, from them nothing diminiſhed, and in their practiſe nothing changed beſides the Inſtitution of the Lord Ieſus, and practiſe of his holy Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And albeit the order of <hi>Geneva</hi> which now is uſed in ſome of our Churches, is ſufficient to inſtruct the diligent Reader how that both theſe Sacraments may bee rightly miniſtred, yet for an uniformity to bee kept, wee have thought good to adde this as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraboundant.</p>
               <p>In Baptiſme wee acknowledge nothing to bee uſed except the element of water onely (that the word and declaration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ought to preceed we have ſaid before) wherefore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſumeth in Baptiſme to uſe oyle, ſalt, waxe, ſpittle conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and croſſing accuſeth the perfect inſtitution of Chriſt leſus, of imperfection. For it was void of all ſuch inventions deviſed by men, and ſuch as would preſume to alter Chriſts perfect Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance you ought ſeverely to puniſh.</p>
               <p>The Table of the Lord is then moſt rightly miniſtred when it approacheth moſt neare to Chriſts owne action. But plaine it is, that at Supper Chriſt Ieſus ſate with his Diſciples; and therefore doe wee judge that ſitting at a Table is moſt convenient to that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95701:20"/>holy action, that bread and wine ought to bee there, that thankes ought to bee given, diſtribution of the ſame made, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given that the bread ſhould bee taken and eaten, and that all ſhould likewiſe drinke of the cup of wine, with declaration what both the one and the other is: wee ſuppoſe no godly man will doubt: For as touching the damnable errour of the Papiſts, who dare defraud the Common people of the one part of that holy Sacrament, to wit, of the cup of the Lords bloud, wee ſuppoſe their errour to bee ſo manifeſt, that it needeth no confutation: neither yet intend wee to confute any thing in this our ſimple Confeſſion, but to offer publick diſputation to all that liſt oppugne any thing affirmed by us.</p>
               <p>That the Miniſter breake the bread and diſtribute the ſame to thoſe that bee next unto him, commanding the reſt, every one with reverence and ſobriety to breake with other, wee thinke it neereſt to Chriſts action, and to the perfect practiſe, as wee reade in Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> during the which action wee thinke it neceſſary, that ſome comfortable places of the Scripture bee read, which may bring in minde the death of Chriſt Jeſus, and the benefit of the ſame. For ſeeing that in that action wee ought chiefly to remember the Lords death, wee judge the Scriptures making mention of the ſame, moſt apt to ſtirre up our dull mindes then, and at all times. Let the diſcretion of the Miniſters appoint the places to bee read as they thinke good. What times wee thinke moſt convenient for the adminiſtration of the one and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Sacraments, ſhall bee declared in the policy of the Church.</p>

               <head>The fourth head concerning Miniſters, and their lawfull Election.</head>
               <p>IN a Church reformed, or tending to reformation, none ought to preſume either to preach, either yet to Miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till that orderly they bee called to the ſame. Ordinarie Vocation conſiſteth in Election, Examination, and Admiſſion. And becauſe that Election of Miniſters in this curſed Papiſtrie hath altogether beene abuſed, wee thinke expedient to intreate it more largely. It appertaineth to the people, and to every ſeverall Congregation to elect their Miniſter: And in caſe that they bee found negligent therein the ſpace of fourty dayes, The beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church to wit, the Church of the Super-intendent with his Councell, may preſent unto them a man whom they judgeapt, to feed the flock of Chriſt Jeſus, who muſt bee examinated as well in life and manners, as in doctrine and knowledge. And that this may bee done with more exact diligence, the perſons that are to bee examinated, muſt bee commanded to appeare before men of ſoundeſt judgment remaining in ſome principall Towne next adjacent unto them, as they that bee in <hi>Fyfe, Angus, Mearnes</hi> or <hi>Straitharne,</hi> to preſent themſelves in Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> Theſe that bee in <hi>Lowthian, Merſe</hi> or <hi>Tevidaill</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and likewiſe thoſe that bee in other Countries muſt reſort to the beſt reformed City and Towne, that is, to the Towne of the Super-intendent, where, firſt in the Schooles, or, failing thereof, in open aſſembly, and before the Congregation, they muſt give declaration of their gifts, utterance and knowledge, by interpreting ſome place of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95701:21"/>Scripture to bee appointed by the Miniſtery; which being ended, the perſon that is preſented, or that offereth himſelfe to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Church, muſt bee examined by the Miniſters and Elders of the Church, and that openly, and before all that liſt to heare, in all the chiefe points that now bee in controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, Arrians, or other ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Chriſtian Religion. In which, if hee bee found ſound, able to perſwade by wholeſome doctrine, and to convince the gaine-ſayer, then muſt hee bee directed to the Church and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation where hee ſhould ſerve, that there in open andience of his Flock in diverſe publick Sermons, hee may give confeſſion of his faith in the article of Juſtification, in the Office of Chriſt Jeſus, of the number, effect, and uſe of the Sacraments, and finally of the whole Religion which heretofore hath beene corrupted by the Papiſts. If his doctrine bee found wholeſome and able to inſtruct the ſimple, and if the Church juſtly can reprehend nothing in his life, doctrine, nor utterance, then wee judge the Church, which before was deſtitute, unreaſonable, if they tefuſe him whom the Church did offer, and they ſhould bee compelled by the cenſure of the Councell and Church, to receive the perſon appointed, and approved by the judgement of the godly and learned: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that the ſame Church, have preſented a man better, or as well qualified to the examination, before that this foreſaid triall was taken of the perſon preſented by the councell of the whole Church: As for example, The councell of the Church, preſents to any Church a man to bee their Miniſter, not knowing that they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provided: in the meane time, the Church is provided of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſufficient in their judgment for that charge, whom they prefent to the learned Miniſters, and next reformed Church to be examined. In this caſe the preſentation of the people, to whom hee ſhould bee appointed Paſtor, muſt bee preferred to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the councell, or greater Church, unleſſe the perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the inferiour Church bee judged unable of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Learned. For altogether this is to bee avoided, that any man bee violently intruded or thruſt in upon any Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this liberty with all care muſt bee reſerved to every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Church, to have their Votes and Suffrages in election of their Miniſters. But violent intruſion wee call not, when the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Church in the feare of God, and for the ſalvation of the people, offereth unto them a ſfficient man to inſtruct them, whom

               <p>IT is to bee obſerved, that no perſon, noted with publique infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or being unable to edifie the Church by wholeſome doctrine, or being knowne of corrupt judgment, bee either promoted to the regiment of the Church, or yet retained in Eccleſiaſticall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>

               <p>BY publick infamy wee underſtand, not the common ſinnes and offences which any hath committed in time of blindnes, by fragility, (if of the ſame by a better and more ſober converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee hath declared himſelfe verily penitent) but ſuch capitall crimes as the Civill ſword ought and may puniſh with death by the word of God. For beſides that the Apoſtle requireth the life of Miniſters to bee ſo irreprehenſible, that they have a good teſtimonie from thoſe that bee without, wee judge it a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly and dangerous, that hee ſhall have publick authority to preach to others life everlaſting, from whom the Civill Magiſtrate may take the life temporall for a crime publickly committed. And if any object, that the Prince hath pardoned his offence, and that hee hath publickly repented, and ſo not only his life is in aſſurance, but alſo that he may bee received to the Miniſtery of the Church; Wee anſwer, that repentance doth not take away the temporall puniſhment of the Law, neither doth the pardon of the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his infamie before man.</p>
               <p>That the life and converſation of the perſon preſented, or to be elected may be the more clearely knowne, publick edicts ſhould be directed to all parts of this Realme, or at the leaſt to thoſe parts where the perſon had beene moſt converſant: as where hee was nouriſhed in letters, or where hee continued ſince the yeares of infancie and childhood were paſſed. Straight commandement would bee given that if any capitall crimes were committed by him, that they ſhould bee notified; as if hee had committed wilfull murder, adultery, if hee were a common fornicator, a thiefe, a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95701:22"/>drunkard, a fighter, brawler, or contentious perſon. Theſe Edicts ought to bee notified in the chiefe Cities, with the like charge and commandement, with declaration that ſuch as concealed his ſinnes knowne did deceive and betray (ſo farre as in them lay) the Church which is the Spouſe of Chriſt Jeſus, and did communicate with the ſinnes of that wicked man.</p>

               <p>THe Admiſſion of Miniſters to their offices muſt conſiſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, and Church whereto they ſhall be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and approbation of the learned Miniſters appointed for their examination.</p>
               <p>Wee judge it expedient that the Admiſſion of Miniſters bee in open audience, that ſome ſpeciall Miniſter make a Sermon touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dutie and office of Miniſters, touching their manners, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and life: as alſo touching the obedience which the Church oweth to their Miniſters. Commandement ſhould bee given as well to the Miniſter as to the people, both being preſent: to wit, That he with all carefull diligence attend upon the flock of Chriſt Jeſus over the which hee is appointed Preacher: That hee will walke in the preſence of God ſo ſincerely, that the graces of the Holy ſpirit may bee multiplied into him, and in the preſence of men ſo ſoberly and uprightly, that his life may confirme in the eyes of men, that which by tongue and word hee perſwaded unto others. The people would bee exhorted to reverence and honor their Miniſters, choſen as the ſervants and Embaſſadors of the Lord Jeſus, obeying the commandements which they pronounce from Gods mouth and book, even as they would obey God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felfe. For whoſoever heareth Chriſts Miniſters, heareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and whoſoever rejecteth and deſpiſeth their miniſtery and exhortation, rejecteth and deſpiſeth Chriſt Ieſus. Other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then the publick approbation of the people, and declaration of the chiefe Miniſter, that the perſon there preſented is appointed to ſerve the Church, wee cannot approve; for labeit the Apoſtles uſed impoſition of hands, yet ſeeing the miracle is ceaſed, the uſing of the ceremony wee judge not neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter elected, or preſented, examined, and as ſaid is, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly admitted, may neither leave the flocke at his pleaſure to which hee had promiſed his fidelity and labours, neither yet may
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95701:23"/>the flock reject nor change him at their appetite, unleſſe they bee able to convict him of ſuch crimes as deſerve depoſition, whereof we ſhall after ſpeake. Wee mean not but that the whole Church, or the moſt part thereof, for juſt conſiderations, may transferre a miniſter from one Church to another: neither yet meane wee, that men who now ſerve as it were of benevolence, may not bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and elected to ſerve in other places; but once being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely elected, and admitted, wee cannot approve that they ſhould change at their owne pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Wee are not ignorant that the rarity of godly and learned men, ſhall ſeeme to ſome a juſt reaſon why that ſo ſtrait and ſharpe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination ſhould not bee taken univerſally, for ſo it ſhall appeare, that the moſt part of the Kirks ſhall have no Miniſter at all. But let theſe men underſtand, that the lack of able men ſhall not excuſe us before God, if by our conſent unable men bee placed over the flock of Chriſt Jeſus. As alſo that amongſt the Gentiles godly and learned men were alſo rare, as they bee now amongſt us, when the Apoſtle gave the ſame rule to trie and examine Miniſters, which wee now follow. And laſt, let them underſtand that it is alike to have no Miniſter at all, and to have an Idoll in the place of a true Miniſter: Yea and in ſome caſe it is worſe, for thoſe that bee utterly deſtitute of Miniſters, will be diligent to ſearch for them; but thoſe that have a vain ſhadow, doe commonly without further care con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with the ſame, and ſo remaine they continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, thinking that they have a Miniſter, when in very deed they have none. For wee cannot judge him a diſpenſator of Gods my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, that in no wiſe can breake the bread of life to the fainting and hungry ſoules. Neither judge wee that the Sacraments can bee rightly miniſtred by him in whoſe mouth God hath put no Sermon of exhortation. The chiefeſt remedy left to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and to us, in all this raritie of true Miniſters, is fervent prayer unto God, that it will pleaſe his mercy to thruſt out faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workmen in this his harveſt. And next, that your Ho. with conſent of the Church, are bound by your authority to compell ſuch men as have gifts and graces able to edifie the Church of God, that they beſtow them where greateſt neceſſity ſhall bee knowne. For no man may bee permitted to live idle, or as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liſt; but muſt bee appointed to travell where your wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and the Church ſhall thinke expedient: We cannot preſcribe unto your Honours certaine rules how that ye ſhall diſtribute the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95701:23"/>Miniſters and learned men, whom God hath already ſent unto you. But hereof wee are aſſured, that it greatly hindereth the progreſſe of Chriſts Goſpell within this poore Realme, that ſome altogether abſtract their labours from the Church, and others remaine alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place, the moſt part of them being idle. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of your Honors we require in Gods name, that by your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which ye have of God, ye compell all men to whom God hath given any Talent to perſwade by wholeſome doctrine, to beſtow the ſame, if they bee called by the Church, to the advancement of Chriſts glorie, and the comfort of his troubled flock. And that ye with the conſent of the Church, aſſigne unto your chiefeſt workmen, not onely Townes to remaine in, but alſo Provinces; that by their faithfull labours, Churches may bee erected, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eſtabliſhed where none is now.

               <head>The fifth head concerning the proviſion for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and for the diſtribution of the rents and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions juſtly appertaining to the Church.</head>
               <p>SEing that of our Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, and his Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> wee have, that the workman is worthy of his reward, and that the mouth of the labouring exe ought not to bee muſſeled, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie it is, that honeſt proviſion bee made for the Miniſters, which wee require to bee ſuch, that they have neither occaſion of ſolicitude, neither yet of inſolencie and wantonneſſe. And this proviſion muſt bee made not onely for their owne ſuſtentation, during their lives; but alſo for their Wives and Children after them. For wee judge it a thing moſt contrarious to reaſon, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and equity, that the Widow and the Children of him who in his life did faithfully ſerve in the Kirk of God, and for that cauſe did not carefully make proviſion for his family, ſhould after his death bee left comfortleſſe of all proviſion: which proviſion for the Wives of the Miniſters after their deceaſe is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the diſcretion of the Kirk. Difficile it is to appoint a ſeverall ſtipend to every Miniſter, by reaſon that the charge and neceſſity of all, will not bee alike. For ſome will bee continuers in one place, ſome will bee compelled to travell, and oft to change their dwelling place (if they ſhall have charge of divers Kirkes;) among theſe ſome will bee burdened with Wife and Children, and one with more then others, and ſome perhaps will bee ſingle men. If equall ſtipends ſhould bee appointed to theſe that in charge ſhould bee ſo unequall, either ſhould the one ſuffer penurie, or elſe ſhould the other have ſuperfluity and too much. Wee judge therefore that every Miniſter have ſufficient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to keepe an houſe, and bee ſuſtained honeſtly in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as well for keeping of his houſe and cloathes, fleſh, fiſh, bookes, fewell, and other things neceſſary, of the rents and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie of the Kirk, at the diſcretion of the Congregation conforme to the quality of the perſon and neceſſity of the time: Wherein
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95701:24"/>it is thought good that every Miniſter ſhall have at leaſt fourty bolls meale, twenty ſix bolls malt, to finde his houſe bread and drinke, and more ſo much as the diſeretion of the Church findes neceſſary; beſides money for buying of other proviſion to his houſe and other neceſſaries: the modification whereof is referred to the judgment of the Kirk, to bee made every yeare at the chooſing of the Elders and Deacons of the Kirk. Providing alwayes that there bee advanced to every Miniſter ſufficient proviſion for a quarter of a yeare before-hand of all things. But to him that travels from place to place, whom wee call Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent, who remaines as it were a month or leſſe in one place for eſtabliſhing of the Kirk, and for the ſame purpoſe changing to another, muſt conſideration bee had. And therefore to ſuch wee thinke ſix chalders beere, nine chalders meale, three chalders oats, ſix hundreth merkes money, to bee eiked and paired at the diſcretion of the Prince and Councell of the Reaſme, to bee payed to him in manner foreſaid. The Children of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt have the liberties of the Cities next adjacent, where their Fathers laboured, freely granted. They muſt have the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in Schooles, and burſiſſes in Colledges; That is, that they ſhall be ſuſtained at learning, if they be found apt thereto: And failing thereof, that they bee put to ſome handy-craft; or exerciſed in ſome vertuous induſtry, whereby they may bee profitable members of the Common-wealth, and the ſame we require of their Daughters: To wit, that they bee vertuouſly brought up, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly doted when they come to maturity of yeares at the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kirk. And this in Gods preſence wee witneſſe wee require not ſo much for our ſelves, or for any that appertaine to us, as that wee doe it for the increaſe of vertue and learning, and for the profite of the poſterity to come. It is not to bee ſuppoſed that any man will dedicate himſelfe and his Children ſo to God and to his Kirk, that they looke for no worldly commodity, but this cankered nature which wee beare is provoked to follow vertue when it ſeeth profite and honour thereto annexed; and contrarily, then is vertue in many deſpiſed, when vertuous and godly men are without honour: and ſory would wee bee that poverty ſhould diſcourage men from ſtudie, and following of the way of vertue, by which they might edifie the Kirk and flock of Chriſt Jeſus. Nothing have wee ſpoken of the ſtipend of Readers, becauſe if they can doe nothing but reade, they neither
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95701:25"/>can bee called nor judged true Miniſters, and yet regard muſt bee had to their labours; but ſo that they may bee ſuprred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to vertue, and not by any ſtipend appointed for their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to bee retained in that eſtate. To a Reader therefore that is newly entred, fourty merkes, or more or leſſe, as Pariſhioners and Readers can agree, is ſufficient: Provided that hee teach the Children of the Pariſh, which hee muſt doe, beſide the reading of the common prayers, and bookes of the old and new Teſtament. If from reading hee begin to exhort, and explaine the Scriptures, then ought his ſtipend to bee augmented, till finally hee come to the honour of a Miniſter. But if hee bee found unable after two yeeres, then muſt hee bee removed from that office, and diſcharged of all ſtipend, that another may bee proved as long. For this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes is to bee avoided, that none who is judged unable to come at any time to ſome reaſonable knowledge whereby hee may edifie the Kirk, ſhall bee perpetually ſuſtained upon the charge of the Kirk. Farther it muſt bee avoided, that no child, nor perſon within age, that is, within twenty one yeares of age, bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the office of a Reader. But Readers ought to bee endued with gravity and diſcretion, leſt by their lightneſſe the prayers or Scriptures read bee of leſſe price or eſtimation. It is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Reader bee put in the Kirk at the admiſſion of the Super-intendent. The other ſort of Readers, who have long continued in godlines, and have ſome gift of exhortation, who are of hope to attaine to the degree of a Miniſter, and teach the Children; wee thinke an hundred merkes, or more or leſſe, at the diſcretion of the Kirk, may bee appointed; ſo that difference bee made, as is ſaid, betwixt them and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that openly preaches the word and miniſters the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Reſts yet two ſorts of people to bee provided for, upon that which is called the Patrimony of the Kirk, to wit, the poore, and teachers of the youth-head. Every ſeverall Kirk muſt provide for the poore within it ſelfe: For fearefull and horrible it is, that the poore, whom not onely God the Father in his Law, but Chriſt Jeſus in his Evangell, and the holy Spirit ſpeaking by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſo earneſtly commended to our care, are univerſally ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and deſpiſed. Wee are not Patrones for ſtubborne and idle beggars, who running from place to place make a craft of their begging, whom the civill Magiſtrate ought to puniſh: But
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95701:25"/>for the Widow and Fatherleſſe, the aged, impotent or lamed, who neither can, nor may travell for their ſuſtentation; wee ſay that God commands his people to bee carefull, and therefore for ſuch, as alſo for perſons of honeſty fallen into decay and poverty, ought ſuch proviſion to bee made, that of our aboundance their indigence might bee relieved. How this moſt conveniently, and moſt eaſily may bee done in every Citie, and other parts of this Realme, God will ſhew you wiſedome, and the meanes, ſo that your mindes bee godly inclined thereto. All muſt not bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to begge that gladly would ſo doe, neither yet muſt beggers remaine where they would; but the ſtout and ſtrong beggers muſt bee compelled to worke; and every perſon that may not worke, muſt bee compelled to repaire to the place where hee or ſhee was borne, unleſſe of long continuance they have remained in one place, and there reaſonable proviſion muſt bee made for ſuſtentation, as the Kirk ſhall appoint. The order nor ſummes in our judgements can not particularly bee appointed unto ſuch times as the poore of every City, Towne and Pariſh bee compelled to repaire to the places where they were borne, or of their reſidence, where their names and number muſt bee taken and put in roll, and then may the wiſedome of the Kirk appoint ſtipends accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

               <p>IN this preſent neceſſity, the nomination, examination, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Super-intendent cannot be ſo ſtraight, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and as afterward it muſt be. For this preſent, therefore wee thinke it expedient, that either your Honours by your ſelves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſo many as may ſerve the fore-written Provinces: or that yee give commiſſion to ſuch men as ye ſuppoſe the feare of God to bein, to doe the ſame. And the ſame men being called in your preſence ſhall bee by you, and ſuch as your Hon, pleaſes call unto you for conſultation in that caſe, appointed to their Provinces. We thinke it expedient, and neceſſary, that as well the Gentlemen, as Burgeſſe of every diocy bee made privy at the ſame to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Super-intendent; as well to bring the Kirk in ſome practiſe of her liberty, as that the Paſtor may be the better favored of the flock whom themſelves have choſen. If your Honours cannot finde for this preſent ſo many able as neceſſity requireth, then in our judgements, more profitable it is thoſe Provinces vaike till God provide better for them, then that men unable to edific and governe the Kirk, ſo ſuddenly be placed in that charge; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath teached us what peſtilence hath beene ingendred in the Kirk by men unable to diſcharge their offices. When therefore after three yeares any Super-intendent ſhall depart, or chance to be depoſed, the chiefe Towne within the Province, to wit, the Miniſters, Elders and Deacons, with the Magiſtrate and Councell of the ſame Towne, ſhall nominate, and by publick Edicts proclaime, as well to the Super-intendent, as to two or three Provinces next adjacent, two or three of the moſt learned
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95701:27"/>and godly Miniſters within the whole Reaſme, that from amongſt them, one with publick conſent may be elected and appointed to the office then vacant: And this the chiefe Towne ſhall be bound to doe within the ſpace of twenty dayes; which being expired, and no man preſented, then ſhall three of the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Provinces with conſent of their Super-intendents, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Elders, enter in the right and priviledge of the Towne, and ſhall preſent every one of them, one or twa, if they liſt, to the chiefe Towne to be examined, as the order requires. As alſo it ſhall bee lawfull for all the Kirkes of the Dioceſſe to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate within the ſame time ſuch perſons as they thinke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſtand in Election, who all muſt bee put in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</p>
               <p>After nomination to be made, publick Edicts muſt be ſent forth, warning all men that have any exception againſt the perſons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, or againſt any of them, to be preſent in the chiefe Towne at the day affixed, and place, to object what they can againſt the election of any of them. Thirty dayes we thinke ſufficient to be aſſigned thereto. Thirty dayes we meane after the nomination be made; which day of the election being come, the whole Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Province, with three or foure Super-intendents next adjacent, or that ſhall bee thereto nominated, ſhall examine, not onely the learning, but alſo the manners, prudence and hability to governe the Kirk, of all theſe that be nominated: that he who ſhall be found moſt worthy may be burdened with the charge. If the Miniſters of the whole Provinces ſhould bring with them the votes of them that were committed to their care, the election ſhould be the more free. But alwayes the votes of them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, ſhould be required. The examinations muſt be publickly made. They that ſtand in election muſt publickly preach, and men muſt be charged in the name of God, to vote according to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not after affection.</p>
               <p>If any thing be objected againſt him that ſtandeth in election, the Super-intendents and Miniſters muſt conſider whether the objection be made of conſcience or malice, and they muſt anſwere accordingly. Other ceremonies then ſharp examination, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Miniſters, and Super-intendents, with the publicke conſent of the Elders and people, wee cannot allow.</p>
               <p>The Super-intendent being elected, and appointed to his charge, muſt be ſubject to the cenſure and correction of Miniſters and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95701:28"/>not of his chiefe Towne onely, but alſo of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, over the which he is appointed Overſeer.</p>
               <p>If his offence be knowne, and the Miniſters and Elders of the Towne and Province be negligent in correcting of him, then the next one or two Super-intendents with their Miniſters and Elders, may convent him, and the Miniſters and Elders of his chief Town (provided that it be within his owne Province or chiefe Towne) may accuſe or correct as well the Superintendent in theſe things that are worthy of correction, as the Miniſters and Elders of their negligence and ungodly tolerance of his offence.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever crime deſerves depoſition or correction of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſter, deſerveth the ſame in the super-intendent, without exception of perſons.</p>
               <p>After that the Kirk is eſtabliſhed, and three yeares be paſſed, we require that no man be called to the office of a Super-intendent, who hath not at the leaſt two years given declaration of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labours in the miniſtery of the ſame Kirk.</p>
               <p>No Super-intendent may be transferred at the pleaſure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of any one Province, no not without the conſent of the whole councell of the Kirk, and that for grave cauſes and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>Of one thing in the end we muſt admoniſh your Honours, to wit, that in the appointing of the Super-intendents for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ye diſ-appoint not your chief Townes, and where learning is exerciſed, of ſuch Miniſters as more may profit by reſidence in one place, then by continuall travell from place to place. For if ye ſo doe, the youth in theſe places ſhall lack the profound interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture: and ſo ſhall it be long before your garden ſend forth many plants; where by the contrary, if one or two Townes be continually exerciſed as they may, the Commonwealth ſhall ſhortly feaſt of their fruit, to the comfort of the godly.</p>

               <head>The neceſsity of Schooles.</head>
               <p>SEeing that God hath determined that his Kirke here in earth ſhall be taught not by Angels, but by men; and ſeeing that men are borne ignorant of God, and of all godlineſſe, and ſeeing alſo he ceaſes to illuminate men miraculouſly, ſuddenly changing them as he did the Apoſtles, and others in the primitive Kirke: Of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it is that your Honours be moſt carefull for the vertuous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and godly up-bringing of the youth of this Realme: if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye now thirſt unfainedly the advancement of Chriſts glory, or yet deſire the continuance of his benefits to the generation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. For as the youth muſt ſucceed to us, ſo we ought to be carefull that they have knowledge and erudition to profit and comfort that which ought to be moſt deare to us, to wit, the Kirk and ſpouſe of our Lord Jeſus. Of neceſſity therefore we judge it, that every ſeverall Kirk have one Schoolmaſter appointed, ſuch a one at leaſt as is able to teach Grammar, and the Latine tongue; if the Towne be of any reputation. If it be up-a-land, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple convene to the doctrine but once in the weeke, then muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Reader, or the Miniſter there appointed, take care over the children and youth of the pariſh, to inſtruct them in the firſt rudiments, and eſpecially in the Catechiſme as we have it now translated in the booke of the common order, called the order of <hi>Geneva.</hi> And furder we thinke it expedient, that in every notable Towne, and ſpecially in the Towne of the Super-intendent, there be erected a Colledge, in which the arts at leaſt Logick and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, together with the tongues, be read by ſufficient Maſters, for whom honeſt ſtipends muſt be appointed. As alſo proviſion for thoſe that be poore, and not able by themſelves, nor by their friends to be ſuſtained at letters, and in ſpeciall theſe that come from Landward. The fruit and commodity hereof ſhall ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. For firſt, the youth-head and tender children ſhall bee nouriſhed, and brought up in vertue in preſence of their friends, by whoſe good attendance many inconveniences may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which the youth commonly fall, either by over much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which they have in ſtrange and unknowne places, while they cannot rule themſelves: or elſe for lack of good attendance, and ſuch neceſſity as their tender age requires. Secondly, the exerciſe of Children in every Kirk, ſhall be great inſtruction to the aged.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95701:29"/>Laſt, the great Schooles, called the Vniverſities, ſhall be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with theſe that ſhall be apt to learning. For this moſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided, hat no Father of what eſtate or condition that ever he be, uſe his Children at his owne fanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, eſpecially in their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but all muſt be compelled to bring up their Children in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vertue.</p>
               <p>The rich and potent may not be permitted to ſuffer their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſpend their youth in vaine idleneſſe, as heretofore they have done: But they muſt be exhorted, and by the cenſure of the Kirk compelled to dedicate their Sonnes by good exerciſes to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Kirk, and Common-wealth; and that they muſt doe of their owne expences, becauſe they are able. The Children of the poore muſt be ſupported and ſuſtained of the charge of the Kirk, triall being taken whether the Spirit of docility be in them found, or not: If they be found apt to learning and letters, then may they not (we meane, neither the Sonnes of the rich, nor yet of the poore) be permitted to reject learning, but muſt be charged to continue their ſtudy, ſo that the Common-wealth may have ſome comfort by them. And for this purpoſe muſt diſcreet, grave, and learned men be appointed to viſit Schooles for the tryall of their exerciſe, profite and continuance: To wit, the Miniſter and Elders, and the reſt of learned men in every Towne ſhall in every quarter make examination how the youth have profited.</p>
               <p>And certaine times muſt be appointed to reading and learning of the Catechiſme, and certaine to the Gramma and to the Latine tongues, and a certaine to the Arts of Philoſophy, and the tongues; and certaine to that ſtudy in the which they intend chiefly to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell for the profite of the Common-wealth. Which time being expired, we meane in every courſe, the Children ſhould either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the farther knowledge, or elſe they muſt be ſet to ſome handy-craft, or to ſome other profitable exerciſe; providing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that firſt they have further knowledge of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: To wit, the knowledge of Gods Law and Commandements, the uſe and office of the ſame: the chiefe Articles of the beleeſe, the right forme to pray unto God; the number, uſe, and effect of the Sacraments: the true knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, of his Office and Natures, and ſuch others, without the knowledge whereof neither any man deſerves to be called a Chriſtian, neither ought any to be admitted to the participation of the Lords Table: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their principles ought and muſt be learned in the youth-head.</p>

               <p>THir two ſorts of men, that is to ſay, Miniſters and the poore, together with the Schooles, when order ſhall be taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent, muſt bee ſuſteined upon the charges of the Kirk; and therefore proviſion muſt bee made how, and by whom ſuch ſummes muſt be lifted. But before we enter in this head, we muſt crave of your Honours, in the name of the eternall God, and of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, that ye have reſpect to your poore brethren, the Labourers and Manurers of the ground; who by their cruell beaſts the Papiſts have before been oppreſt, that their life to them hath been dolorous and bitter. If yee will have God authour and approver of this reformation, ye muſt not follow their foot-ſteps, but yee muſt have compaſsion of your brethren, appointing them to pay reaſonable teinds, that they may finde ſome benefit of Chriſt Jeſus now preached unto them.</p>
               <p>With the griefe of our hearts we heare, that ſome Gentlemen are now as cruell over their Tenants, as ever were the Papiſts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of them whatſoever they afore payed to the Kirk; ſo that the Papiſticall tyrannie ſhall only be changed into the tyrannie of the Lord &amp; Laird. We dare not flatter your Honours, neither yet is it profitable for you that we ſo doe. If we permit crueltie to be uſed, neither ſhall ye, who by your authoritie ought to gainſtand ſuch oppreſsion, nor yet they that uſe the ſame eſcape Gods heavie and fearefull judgements. The Gentlemen, Barons, Earles, Lords and others, muſt be content to live upon their juſt rents, and ſuffer the Kirk to be reſtored to her libertie; that in her reſtitution, the poore, who heretofore by the cruell Papiſts have been ſpoiled and oppreſſed, may now receive ſome comfort and relaxation, that their teinds and other exactions be cleane diſcharged, and no more taken in times comming. The uppermoſt claith corpſ-preſent; clerk-maile, the Paſche offering, teind-aile and all handlings upa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, can neither bee required, nor received of good conſcience: Neither do we judge it to proceed of juſtice, that any man ſhould poſſeſſe the teinds of another, but we think it a moſt reaſonable thing that every man have the uſe of his owne teinds, provided that he anſwer to the Deacons and Treaſurers of the Kirk, of that which juſtice ſhall be appointed to him. We require the Deacons
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95701:33"/>and Treaſures, rather to receive the rents, then the Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; becauſe that of the tiends muſt not onely the Miniſter be ſuſteined, but alſo the poore and ſchooles. And therefore we think it expedient that common Treaſurers; to wit, the Deacons be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from yeare to yeare, to receive the whole rents appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Kirk, and that commandement be given that none be permitted either to receive, or yet to intromet with any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteining to the ſuſtination of the perſons foreſaid, but ſuch as by common conſent of the Kirk are thereto appointed.</p>
               <p>If any think this prejudiciall to the tackes and aſſedations of them that now poſſeſſe the tiends. Let them underſtand, that their unjuſt poſſeſſion is no poſſeſſion before God; for they of whom they received their title, and preſuppoſed right or warrant, were theeves and murtherers, and had no power ſo to alienate the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, and common good of the Kirk. And yet we are not ſo extreme, but that we wiſh juſt recompence to be made to ſuch as have deburſed ſummes of money to the unjuſt profeſſors, ſo that it hath not been done of late dayes in prejudice of the Kirk. But ſuch as are found and known to be done of plaine colluſion, in no wayes ought to be maintained by you. And for that purpoſe we thinke it moſt expedient that whoſoever have aſſedation of tiends and Kirks, be openly warned to produce their aſſedation and aſſurance, that cognition being taken, the juſt takeſmen may have the juſt and reaſonable recompence for the yeares that are to runne, the profit of the yeares paſt being conſidered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and the unjuſt and ſurmiſed may be ſerved accordingly; ſo that the Kirk in the end may receive her libertie and freedom, and that onely for the reliefe of the poore. Your Honours may eaſilie underſtand that we ſpeake not now for our ſelves, but in favour of the Labourers defrauded and oppreſt by the Prieſts, and by their confederate penſioners; for while that the Prieſts Penſioner his idle belly is delicately fed, the poore, to whom the portion of that appertaines, was pined with hunger; and moreover the true labourer was compelled to pay that which he ought not. For the labourer is neither debtor to the dumb dog, called the Biſhop, neither yet to his hired penſioner; but is debter onely to the Kirk. And the Kirk is bound to ſuſtaine and nouriſh of her charges, the perſons before mentioned, to wit, the Miniſters of the word, the poore, and the teachers of the youth. But now to returne to the former head. The ſummes able to ſuſtaine the forenamed perſons,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95701:33"/>and to furniſh all things appertaing to the preſervation of good order and policie within the Kirk, muſt bee lifted off the tenths, to wit, the tenth ſheafe, hay, hemp, lint, fiſhes, tenth calfe, tenth lamb, tenth wool, tenth folle, tenth cheeſe. And becauſe that we know that the tenth reaſonably taken, as is before expreſſed, will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to diſcharge the former neceſſitie, we think that all things do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in hoſpitalitie, and annuall rents both in burgh and land, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Prieſts, Chantorie Colledges, Chappellanties, &amp; the Freeries of all orders, to the ſiſters of the Seenes, and ſuch others, be reteined ſtill in the uſe of the Kirk or Kirks within the Townes and pariſhes where they were doted. Furthermore, to the uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Univerſities, and ſuſtentaaion of the Superintendents, the whole revennue of the temporalitie of the Biſhops, Deanes, and Archdeanes lands, and of all rents of lands pertaining to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Kirks whatſoever. And further Merchants and rich crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in free Burghs, having nothing to doe with the manuring of the ground, muſt take ſome proviſion of their Cities, Townes, and dwelling places for to ſupport the need of the Kirk.</p>
               <p>To the Miniſters, and failing thereof, the Readers, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored their Manſes and Gleibs; for elſe they cannot ſerve the flock at all times, as their dutie is; If any Gleib exceed ſix Acres of ground, the reſt to remain in the hands of the poſſeſſours, till order be taken therein.</p>
               <p>The receivers and collectors of theſe rents and duties, muſt be Deacons or Treaſurers appointed from yeare to yeare in every Kirk, and by the common conſent, and free election of the Kirk. The Deacons muſt diſtribute no part of that which is collected, but by command of the Miniſters and Elders. And that they may command nothing to be delivered, but as the Kirk hath before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; to wit, the Deacons ſhall of the firſt part pay the ſums, either quarterly, or from halfe yeare to halfe yeare, to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which the Kirk hath appointed. The ſame they ſhall doe to the Schoolemaſters, Readers, and Hoſpitall, if any bee, receiving alwayes an acquittance for their diſcharge. If any extraordinarie ſummes be to be delivered, then muſt the Miniſters, Elders, and Deacons; conſult whether the deliverance of ſuch ſummes, doth ſtand with the common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95701:34"/>the whole Kirk muſt be made privie, and after that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be proponed, and the reaſons; the judgement of the Kirk with the Miniſters conſent ſhall prevaile. The Deacons ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled and bound to make accounts to the Miniſter and Elders of that which they received, as oft as the policie ſhall appoint: and the Elders when they are changed (which muſt be every yeare) muſt cleare their counts before ſuch Auditers as the Kirk ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point: and both the Deacons and Elders being changed ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to them that ſhall be new elected all ſummes of monie corns and other profits reſting in their hands: The tickets whereof muſt be delivered to the Super-intendants in their viſitation, &amp; by them to the great councell of the Kirk; that as well the abundance as the indigence, of every Kirk may be evidently known, that a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable equalitie may be had throughout this whole Realme. If this order be perfectly kept, corruption cannot ſuddenly enter. For the free and yearly election of Deacons and Elders ſhall ſuffer none to uſurpe a perpetuall domination over the Kirk: the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the rentall ſhall ſuffer them to receive no more, then whereof they ſhall be bound to make accounts: the deliverance of monie to the new officers ſhall not ſuffer private men uſe in their private buſineſſe, that which appertaines to the publick affaires of the Kirk.</p>

               <p>AS that no Common-wealth can flouriſh, or long endure, without good Lawes and ſharpe execution of the ſame; ſo neither can the Kirk of God be brought to puritie, neither yet be retained in the ſame without the order of Eccleſiaſticall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, which ſtands in reproving and correcting of the faults, which the civill ſword either doth neglect, or not puniſh: blaſphemie, adulterie, murder, perjurie, and other crimes capitall, worthy of death, ought not properly to fall under cenſure of the Kirk; becauſe all ſuch open tranſgreſſors of Gods lawes, ought to be taken away by the civill ſword. But drunkenneſſe, exceſſe, be it in apparell, or be it in eating and drinking, fornication, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the poore by exactions, deceiving of them in buying and ſelling by wrang met and meaſure, wanton words and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious living tending to ſlander, doe openly appertaine to the Kirk of God to puniſh them, as Gods word commands. But becauſe this accurſed Papiſtrie hath brought in ſuch confuſion into the world, that neither was vertue rightly praiſed, neither yet vice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95701:34"/>puniſhed, the Kirk of God is compelled to draw the ſword, which of God ſhe hath received, againſt ſuch open and manifeſt contemners, curſing and excommunicating all ſuch, as well thoſe whom the civill ſword ought to puniſh, as the other, from all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation with her in prayers and Sacraments, till open repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance appeare manifeſtly in them. As the order and proceeding to excommunication ought to be ſlow and grave, ſo being once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt any perſon of what eſtate or condition that ever they be, it muſt be kept with all ſeveritie. For lawes made and not kept, engender contempt of vertue; and brings in confuſion and libertie to ſinne. And therefore this order we think expedient to be obſerved afore, and after excommunication. Firſt, if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be ſecret or known to few men, &amp; rather ſtands in ſuſpition then in manifeſt probation, the offender ought to be privately admoniſhed, to abſtaine from all appearance of evill, which if hee promiſe to doe, and declare himſelfe ſober, honeſt, and one that feares God, and feares to offend his brethren, then may the ſecret admonition ſuffice for his correction. But if he either contemne the admonition, or after promiſe made do ſhew himſelfe no more circumſpect then he was before, then muſt the Miniſter admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, to whom if he be found inobedient they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the rule of Chriſt, as after ſhall be declared. If the crime be publick, and ſuch as is hainous, as fornication, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, fighting, common ſwearing, or execration, then ought the offender to be called in preſence of the Miniſter, Elders and Deacons, where his ſinne and treſpaſſe ought to be declared and aggreged; ſo that his conſcience may ſeele how farre he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, and what ſlander he hath raiſed in the Kirk. If ſignes of unfained repentance appeare in him, and if he require to be admitted to publick repentance, the Miniſter may appoint unto him a day, when the whole Kirk convenes together, that in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all he may teſtifie his repentance, which before hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. Which if he accept, and with reverence confeſſe his ſinne, doing the ſame, and earneſtly deſiring the Congregation to pray to God with him for mercy, and to accept him in their ſocietie notwithſtanding the former offence; Then the Kirk may and ought to receive him as a penitent. For the Kirk ought to be no more ſevere, then God declares himſelfe to be, who witneſſes that in whatſoever houre a ſinner unfainedly repents, and turnes from his wicked way, that he will not remember one of his iniquities.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95701:35"/>And therefore ought the Kirk diligently to advert, that it excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate not thoſe whom God abſolves. If the offender called before the Miniſterie be found ſtubborn, hard-hearted, or in whom no ſigne of repentance appeares, then muſt he be dimitted with an exhortation to conſider the dangerous eſtate in which hee ſtands, aſſuring him, that if they finde in him no other tokens of amendment of life, that they will be compelled to ſeek a further remedie. If he within a certaine ſpace ſhew his repentance to the Miniſterie, they may preſent him to the Kirk, as before is ſaid: If he continue not in his repentance, then muſt the Kirk be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed, that ſuch crimes are commited amongſt them, which by the Miniſterie have been reprehended, and the perſons provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to repent; whereof becauſe no ſignes appeare unto them, they could not but ſignifie unto the Kirk the crimes, but not the perſon; requiring them earneſtly to call to God to move and touch the heart of the offender, ſo that ſuddenly and earneſtly hee may repent. If the perſon maligne, the next day of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblie, the crime and the perſon muſt be both notified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kirk, and their judgements muſt be required, if that ſuch crimes ought to be ſuffred unpuniſhed amongſt them; requeſt alſo ſhould be made to the moſt diſcreet and neareſt friend of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to travell with him to bring him to knowledge of himſelf, and of his dangerous eſtate, with a commandement given to all men to call to God for the converſion of the unpenitent. If a ſolemne and ſpeciall prayer were drawne for that purpoſe, the thing ſhould be more gravely done. The third Sunday the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to require, if the unpenitent have declared any ſignes of repentance to one of the Miniſterie; and if he have, then may the Miniſter appoint him to be examined by the whole Miniſterie, either then inſtantly, or another day affixed to the Conſiſtorie: and if repentance appeare, as well for his crime, as for his long contempt, then he may be preſented to the Kirk; and make his confeſsion to be accepted as before is ſaid: But if no man fignifie his repentance, then ought he to be excommunicated, and by the mouth of the Miniſter, and conſent of the Miniſterie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Kirk muſt ſuch a contemner be pronounced excommunicate from God, and from all ſocietie of the Kirk. After which ſentence may no perſon (his wife and familie onely excepted) have any kind of converſation with him, be it in eating and drinking, buying and felling; yea, in ſaluting or talking with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95701:35"/>him, except that it be at commandement or licence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie for his converſion, that hee, by ſuch meanes confounded, ſeeing himſelfe abhorred of the godly and faithfull, may have occaſion to repent and ſo be ſaved. The ſentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt bee publiſhed univerſally throughout the Realme, leſt that any man ſhould pretend ignorance. His children begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and borne after that ſentence, and before his repentance may not be admitted to Baptiſme, till either they be of age to require the ſame, or elſe that the mother, or ſome of his ſpeciall friends, members of the Kirk, offer and preſent the childe, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and damning the iniquity, and obſtinate contempt of the impenitent.</p>
               <p>If any man ſhould thinke it ſevere that the child ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for the iniquitie of the father: let him underſtand that the Sacraments appertaine to the faithfull and their ſeed; but ſuch as ſtubbornly contemne all godlyadmonition, and obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaine in their iniquitie, cannot bee accounted amongſt the faithfull.</p>

               <p>WEe have ſpoken nothing of them that commit horrible crimes, as murtherers, manſlayers, adulterers; for ſuch, as we have ſaid, the civill ſword ought to puniſh to dead: But in caſe they be permitted to live, then muſt the Kirk, as is before ſaid, draw the ſword which of God ſhee hath received, holding them as accurſed even in their very fact. The offender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt called, and order of the Kirk uſed againſt him in the ſame manner, as the perſons for their obſtinate impenitency are publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicate.

The Miniſt muſt examin him diligently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he findes a hatred or diſpleaſure of his ſinne, as well of his contempt, as of his crime: which if he confeſſe, he muſt travell with him, to ſee what hope he hath of Gods mercies; and if he find him reaſonably inſtructed in the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, in the vertue of his death, then may the Miniſter comfort him with Gods infallible promiſes, and demand of the Kirk if they be content to receive that creature of God whom Satan before had drawne in his nets, in the ſocietie of their body, ſeeing that hee declared himſelfe pentient. Which if the Kirk grant, as they cannot juſtly deny the ſame, then ought the Miniſter in publick prayer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to God, confeſſe the ſinne of that offender before the whole Kirk, deſiring mercy and grace for Chriſt Jeſus ſake. Which prayer being ended, the Miniſter ought to exhort the Kirk to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that penitent brother in their favours, as they require God to receive themſelves when they offend. And in ſigne of their conſent, the Elders, and chiefe men of the Kirk, ſhall take the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent by the hand, and one or two in the name of the reſt ſhall kiſſe and imbrace him with reverence and gravity, as a member of Chriſt Jeſus. Which being done, the Miniſter ſhall exhort the received that he take diligent heed in times comming that Sathan trap him not in ſuch crimes, admoniſhing him that he will not ceaſe to tempt and try by all meanes poſſible to bring him from that obedience which he hath given to God, and to the ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt. The exhortation being ended, the Miniſter ought to give publik thankes unto God for the converſion of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for all benefits which we receive of Chriſt Jeſus, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the increaſe and continuance of the ſame. If the penitent after he hath offered himſelfe unto the Miniſtrie, or to the Kirk, be found ignorant of the principall points of our Religion, and chiefly in the Articles of Juſtification, and of the office of Chriſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95701:36"/>Jeſus, then ought he to be exactly inſtructed before he be received: For a mocking of God it is to receive them to repentance, who know not wherein ſtandeth their remedy, when they repent their ſinne.</p>

               <p>MEN of beſt knowledge in Gods word, and cleaneſt life, men faithfull and of moſt honeſt converſation that can be found in the Kirk, muſt bee nominate to be in election, and their names muſt be publickly read to the whole Kirk by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, giving them advertiſement, that from amongſt them muſt be choſen Elders and Deacons. If any of theſe nominate be noted with publicke infamy, he ought to be repelled. For it is not ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the ſervant of corruption ſhall have authoritie to judge in the Kirk of God.</p>
               <p>If any man know other of better qualities within the Kirk, then theſe that be nominate, let them be put in election, that the Kirk may have the choyce.</p>
               <p>If the Kirk be of ſmaller number then that Seniors and Deacons can be choſen from amongſt them, then may they well be joyned to the next adjacent Kirks. For the plurality of Kirks without Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and order, ſhall rather hurt then edifie.</p>
               <p>The election of Elders and Deacons ought to be uſed every year once, which wee judge to be moſt convenient at the firſt day of Auguſt leſt of long continuance of ſuch officers, men preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the liberty of the Kirk. It hurteth not that one be received in office moe years then one, ſo that he be appointed yearly by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and free election; provided alwayes that the Deacons and Theſaurers be not compelled to receive the office againe for the ſpace of three yeares.</p>
               <p>How the votes and ſuffrages may be beſt received, ſo that every
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95701:37"/>man may give his vote freely, every ſeverall Kirk may take ſuch order as beſt ſeemes them.</p>
               <p>The Elders being elected, muſt be admoniſhed of their office, which is to aſſiſt the Miniſters in all publike affaires of the Kirk, to wit, in determining and judging cauſes, in giving admonition to the licentious liver, in having reſpect to the manners and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of all men within their charge. For by the gravity of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors, the light &amp; unbridled life of the licentious, muſt be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, &amp; bridled. Yea the Seniors ought to take heed to the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, diligence and ſtudy of their Miniſters. If he be worthy of admonition, they muſt admoniſh him; of correction, they muſt correct him: and if he be worthy of depoſition, they, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Kirk, and Super-intendent, may depoſe him, ſo that his crime deſerve ſo. If a Miniſter be light of converſation, by his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Deacons he ought to be admoniſhed. If he be negligent in ſtudy, or one that vaikes not upon his charge, or flock, or one that propones not faithfull doctrine, he deſerves ſharper admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; correction. To the which if hee be found ſtubborn and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, then may the Seniors of the Kirk complaine to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the two next adjacent Kirks, where men of greater gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are. To whoſe admonition if he be found inobedient, he ought to be diſcharged of his Miniſtrie, till his repentance appeare, and a place be vakand for him. If any Miniſter be deprehended in any notable crime, as whordom, adultery, manſlaughter, perjury, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hereſie, or any other deſerving death, or that may be a note of perpetuall infamie, he ought to be depoſed for ever. By herefie we mean pernicious doctrine plainly taught, and openly defended, againſt the foundations and principles of our faith: and ſuch a crime we judge to deſerve perpetuall depoſition from the Miniſtry. For moſt dangerous we know it to be to commit the flocke to a man infected with the peſtilence of hereſie. Some crimes deſerve depoſition for a time, &amp; while the perſon give declaration of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gravitie and honeſtie. And if a Miniſter be deprehended drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, brawling, or fighting, an open ſlanderer, or infamer of his neighbours, factious, and a ſower of diſcord, he muſt be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ceaſe from his Miniſtrie, till he declare ſome ſign of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, upon the which the Kirk ſhall abide him the ſpace of 20. dayes, or further, as the Kirk ſhal think expedient, before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a new election. Every inferiour Kirk ſhall by one of their Seniors, and one of their Deacons, once in the yeare, notifie unto
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95701:37"/>the Miniſters of the Super-intendents Kirk, the life, manners, ſtudy &amp; diligence of their Miniſters, to the end the diſcretion of ſome may correct the levity of others. Not only muſt the life &amp; maners of Miniſters come under cenſure &amp; judgement of the Kirk, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of their wives, children and familie, judgement muſt be taken, that he neither live riotouſly, neither yet avaritiouſly; yea reſpect muſt be had how they ſpend the ſtipend appointed to their living. If a reaſonable ſtipend be appointed, and they live avaritiouſly, they muſt be admoniſhed to live as they receive: for as exceſſe &amp; ſuperfluitie is not tolerable in a Miniſter, ſo is avarice &amp; the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſollicitude of money, utterly to be damned in Chriſts ſervants, &amp; eſpecially in them that are fed upon the charge of the Kirk. We judge it unſeemly and untolerable that Miniſters ſhall be buirded in common Ale-houſes, or in Tavernes, neither yet muſt a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be permitted to frequent &amp; commonly haunt the Court, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be for a time when he is either ſent by the Kirk, either yet called for by the authoritie, for his counſell &amp; judgement in civill affaires, neither yet muſt he be one of the Councell, be he judged never ſo apt for the purpoſe. But either muſt he ceaſe from the miniſtery (which at his own pleaſure he may not doe) or elſe from bearing charge in civill affaires, unleſſe it be to aſſiſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they be called.</p>
               <p>The office of Deacons, as before is ſaid, is to receive the rents, &amp; gather the almes of the Kirk, to keep and diſtribute the ſame as by the Miniſters and Kirk ſhall be appointed; they may alſo aſſiſt in judgement with the Miniſter and Elders, and may be admitted to read in aſſembly, if they be required, and be able thereto.</p>
               <p>The Elders and Deacons with their wives and houſhold, ſhould be under the ſame cenſure that is preſcribed for the Miniſters. For they muſt be carefull over their office, and ſeeing they are judges over others manners, their own converſation ought to be irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible. They muſt be ſober, lovers and maintainers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and peace: and finally, they ought to be examples of godlines to others. And if the contrary thereof appeare, they muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed thereof by the Miniſters, or ſome of their brethren of the Miniſterie, if the fault be ſecret: and if the fault be open and known, they muſt be rebuked before the Miniſterie, and the ſame order kept againſt the Senior and Deacon, that before is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed againſt the Miniſter. We think it not neceſſary, that any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſtipend ſhall be appointed, either to the Elders, or yet to the

               <head>The ninth head concerning the policie of the Kirk.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>POlicie</hi> wee call an exerciſe of the Kirk in ſuch things as may bring the rude and ignorant to knowledge, or elſe inflame the learned to greater fervencie, or to reteine the Kirk in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: And thereof there bee two ſorts, the one utterly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that the word be truly preached, the ſacraments rightly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, common prayers publickly made, that the children &amp; rude perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be inſtructed in the chief points of religion, &amp; that offences be corrected &amp; puniſhed: Theſe things be ſo neceſſary, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame there is no face of a viſible Kirk. The other is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but not meerly neceſſary. That Pſalms ſhould be ſung, that certain places of the Scripture be read when there is no ſermon, that this day or that, few or many in the week, the Kirk ſhould aſſemble: Of theſe and ſuch others, we cannot ſee how a certaine order can be eſtabliſhed; For in ſome kirkes the Pſalms may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be ſung, in others perchance they cannot. Some kirkes convene every day, ſome twice, ſome thrice in the week, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance but once. In this and ſuch like muſt every particular kirk by their conſent appoint their owne policie. In great Townes we thinke expedient that every day there be either Sermon, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers, with ſome exerciſe of reading of Scriptures. What day the publick Sermon is, we can neither require nor greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that the common prayers be publickly uſed, leſt that wee ſhall either foſter the people in ſuperſtition, who come to the prayers, as they come to the Maſſe; or elſe give them occaſion, that they think them no prayers, but which be made before and after Sermons.</p>
               <p>In every notable town, we require that one day beſide the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day be appointed to the Sermon and prayers, which, during the time of Sermon, muſt be kept free from all exerciſe of labour, as well of the Maſter as of the Servant. In ſmaller townes, as wee have ſaid, the common conſent of the kirk muſt put order, but the Sunday muſt ſtraitly be kept both before &amp; after noone in all townes. Before noone muſt the word be preached, and Sacraments minſtred, as alſo marriage ſolemnized, if occaſion offer: after noone muſt the yong children be publickly examined in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95701:38"/>in the audience of the people, whereof the Miniſter muſt take great diligence, as well to cauſe the people underſtand the queſtions proponed as anſwers, and that doctrine that may be collected thereof.</p>
               <p>The order, &amp; how much is appointed for every Sunday is already diſtinguiſhed in the book of our common order, which Catechiſm is the moſt perfect that ever yet was uſed in the kirk; and after noone may Baptiſme be miniſtred, when occaſion is offered of great travell before noone. It is alſo to be obſerved, that prayers be after noone upon Sunday, where there is neither preaching nor catechiſme. It appertaines to the policie of the kirk to appoint the times when the Sacraments ſhall be miniſtred. Baptiſme may be miniſtred whenſoever the word is preached: But we think it more expedient that it be miniſtred upon Sunday, or upon the day of prayers only after the Sermon; Partly to remove this groſſe errour, by the which many are deceived, thinking that children be damned if they die without Baptiſm; and partly to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have greater reverence to the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then they have: for we ſee the people begin already to wax weary by reaſon of the frequent repetition of thoſe promiſes.</p>
               <p>Foure times in the yeare we think ſufficient to the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Table, which we deſire to be diſtincted, that the ſuperſtition of times may be avoided ſo farre as may be. For your Honours are not ignorant how ſuperſtitiouſly the people runne to that action at Paſche, even as if the time gave vertue to the Sacrament; and how the reſt of the whole year, they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and negligent, as if it appertained not unto them, but at that time onely. We think therefore moſt expedient, that the firſt Sunday of March be appointed for one time, the firſt Sunday of June for another, the firſt Sunday of September for the third, the firſt Sunday of December for the fourth. We doe not deny but any ſeverall kirk for reaſonable cauſes may change the time, and may miniſter oftner, but we ſtudy to repreſſe ſuperſtition. All Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt be admoniſhed to be more carefull to inſtruct the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, then ready to ſerve their appetite, and to uſe more ſharp examination, then indulgence, in admitting to their great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſuch as be ignorant of the uſe and vertue of the ſame. And therfore we think that the adminiſtration of the Table ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be without examination paſſing before, &amp; ſpecially of them whoſe knowledge is ſuſpect. We think that none are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95701:39"/>to this Myſterie, who can not formally ſay the Lords prayer, the Articles of the Beliefe, and declare the ſumme of the Law. Further, we think it a thing moſt expedient &amp; neceſſary, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kirk have the Bible in Engliſh, and that the people be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to convene and heare the plaine reading and interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scripture, as the Kirk ſhall appoint. By frequent reading, this groſſe ignorance, which in this curſed Papiſtry hath overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, may partly be removed. We thinke it moſt expedient that the Scripture be read in order: that is, that ſome one book of the old or new Teſtament be begun and orderly read to the end: And the ſame we judge of preaching where the Miniſter for the moſt part remaines in one place. For this skipping and divagation from place to place of Scripture be it in reading, or be it in preaching we judge not ſo profitable to edifie the Kirk, as the continuall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of one text. Every Maſter of houſhold muſt be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either to inſtruct, or cauſe to be inſtructed, his children, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and familie, in the principalls of the Chriſtian Religion, without the knowledge whereof, ought none to be admitted to the Table of the Lord Jeſus. For ſuch as be ſo dull, and ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that they can neither try themſelves, nor yet know the dignitie and myſterie of that action, cannot eat and drink of that Table worthily. And therefore of neceſſity we judge, that every yeare at the leaſt, publick examination be had by the Miniſters &amp; Elders of the knowledge of every perſon, within the Kirk; to wit, that every Maſter and Miſtreſſe of houſhold come themſelves, and their family, ſo many as be come to maturity before the Miniſter and the Elders, &amp; give confeſſion of their faith. If they underſtand not, nor cannot rehearſe the commandements of Gods law, know not how to pray, neither wherein their righteouſneſſe ſtands, or conſiſts, they ought not to be admitted to the Lords Table. And if they ſtubbornly contemne, &amp; ſuffer their children and ſervants to continue in wilfull ignorance, the diſcipline of the Kirk muſt proceed againſt them to excommunication: and then muſt that matter be referred to the Civill Magiſtrate. For ſeeing that the juſt lives by his own faith, and Chriſt Jeſus juſtifies by knowledge of himſelfe, inſufferable we judge it that men be permitted to live and continue in ignorance, as members of the Kirk.</p>
               <p>Moreover, men, women, Children, would be exhorted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves in Pſalmes, that when the Kirke doth convent and ſing, they may be the more able together, with common
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95701:39"/>hearts and voyces to praiſe God. In private houſes we think expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that the moſt grave and diſcreet perſon uſe the common prayers at morne and at night, for the comfort and inſtruction of others. For ſeeing that we behold and ſee the hand of God now preſently ſtriking us with divers plagues, we thinke it a contempt of his judgements, or provocation of his anger more to be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt us, if we be not moved to repentance of our former unthankfulneſſe, and to earneſt invocation of his name, whoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power may, and great mercy will, if we unfainedly convert unto him, remove from us their terrible plagues, which now for our iniquities hang over our heads. <hi>Convert us ô Lord, and we ſhall be converted.</hi>

               <head>For Prophecying, or Interpreting of the Scriptures.</head>
               <p>TO the end that the Kirk of God may have a tryall of mens knowledge, judgements, graces and utterances, as alſo ſuch that have ſomewhat profited in Gods word, may from time to time grow in more full perfection to ſerve the Kirk, as neceſſity ſhall require, it is more expedient that in every towne, where Schooles and repaire of learned men are, there be in one certaine day every week appointed to that exerciſe, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals prophecying; The order whereof is expreſſed by him in their words, <hi>Let two or three Prophets ſpeake, and let the reſt judge: But if any thing be revealed to him that ſits by, let the former keep ſilence: yee may one by one all propheſie that all may learne, and all may receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. And the ſpirit, that is, the judgements of the Prophets, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Prophets.</hi> By which words of the Apoſtle it is evident, that in the Kirk of Corinth, when they did aſſemble for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſome place of Scripture was read, upon the which one firſt gave his judgement to the inſtruction &amp; conſolation of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: after whom did another, either confirm what the former had ſaid, or added what he had omitted, or did gently correct, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine more properly, where the whole veritie was not revealed to the former. And in caſe things were hid from the one, and from the other, liberty was given for a third to ſpeake his judgement to the edification of the Kirk. Above which number of three (as appeares) they paſſed not, for avoiding of confuſion. This exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe is a thing moſt neceſſary for the Kirk of God this day in Scotland. For thereby, as ſaid is, ſhall the Kirk have judgement, and knowledge of the graces, gifts, and utterances of every man
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95701:40"/>within their body. The ſimple, and ſuch as have ſomwhat profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhal be encouraged daily to ſtudy &amp; to proceed in knowledge, the Kirk ſhall be edified. For this exerciſe muſt be patert to ſuch as liſt to heare and learne, &amp; every man ſhall have liberty to utter and declare his minde and knowledge to the comfort and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Kirk. But leſt of this profitable exerciſe there ariſe debate and ſtrife, curious, peregrine, and unprofitable queſtions are to be avoided. All interpretation diſagreeing from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our faith, repugning to charity, or that ſtands in plaine contradiction with any other manifeſt place of Scripture, is to be rejected. The Interpreter in this exerciſe may not take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the liberty of a publick Preacher (yea, although he be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter appointed) but he muſt bind himſelfe to his text, that hee enter not in digreſſion, or in explaining common places: he may uſe no invective in that exerciſe, unleſſe it be of ſobriety in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing hereſies: in exhortations or admonitions he muſt be ſhort, that the time may be ſpent in opening the minde of the Holy Ghoſt in that place: following the ſequele and dependence of the text, and obſerving ſuch notes as may inſtruct and edifie the auditor for avoiding of contention: neither may the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter nor any in the Aſſemblie move any queſtion in open au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, whereto himſelfe is not able to give reſolution, without reaſoning with another, but every man ought to ſpeake his own judgement to the edification of the Kirk.</p>
               <p>If any be noted with curioſity of bringing in of ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he muſt be admoniſhed by the Moderator, Miniſters and Elders, immediately after the interpretation is ended.</p>
               <p>The whole Miniſters, a number of them that are of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, ought to convene together, where examination ſhould be had, how the perſons that did interprete did handle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the matter (they themſelves being removed;) to every man muſt be given his cenſure. After the which, the perſon being called, the faults (if any notable be found) are noted, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon gently admoniſhed.</p>
               <p>In that Aſſembly are all queſtions and doubts, if any ariſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved without contention; the Miniſters of the Pariſh Kirks in Landwart adjacent to every chiefe Town, and the Readers, if they have any gift of interpretation, within ſix miles, muſt concurre and aſſiſt theſe that prophecie within the townes, to the end that they themſelves may either learne, or others may learne by them.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95701:40"/>And moreover men in whom is ſuppoſed to be any gift which might edifie the Church, if they were well imployed, muſt be charged by the Miniſter and Elders, to joyne themſelves with the ſeſſion, and company of Interpreters, to the end that the Kirk may judge whether they be able to ſerve to Gods glory, &amp; to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Kirk in the vocation of Miniſters or not: And if any be found diſobedient, and not willing to communicate the gifts and ſpeciall graces of God with their brethren, after ſufficient ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Diſcipline muſt proceed againſt them, provided that the civill Magiſtrate concurre with the judgement and election of the Kirk. For no man may be permitted as beſt pleaſeth him, to live within the Kirk of God, but every man muſt be conſtrained by fraternall admonition and correction, to beſtow his labours, when of the Kirk he is required, to the edification of others. What day in the week is moſt convenient for that exerciſe, what books of Scripture ſhall be moſt profitable to read, we refer to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every particular Kirk, we meane, to the wiſedome of the Miniſters and Elders.</p>

And if they, to wit, the Miniſter or Magiſtrate find no cauſe, that is juſt, why the marriage required may not be fulfilled, then after ſufficient admonition to the father, friend, maſter, or ſuperiour, that none of them reſiſt the work of God, the Miniſter or Magiſtrate may enter in the place of parents, and be conſenting to their juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, may admit them to marriage; For the work of God ought not to be hindred by the corrupt affections of worldly men. The work of God we call, when two hearts, without filthineſſe before committed, are ſo joyned, &amp; both require and are content to live together in that holy band of Matrimony. If any commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with that woman hee requires in Marriage, they doe both loſe this foreſaid benefit as well of the Kirk, as of the Magiſtrate; For neither of both ought to be interceſſors or advocats for filthy fornicators. But the father or neereſt friend, whoſe daughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a virgine is defloured, hath power by the law of God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the man that did that injurie to marry his daughter: and if the father wil not accept him by reaſon of his offence, then may he require the dowry of his daughter, which if the offender be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay, then ought the civill Magiſtrate to puniſh his body by ſome other puniſhment. And becauſe whoredome, fornication, adulterie, are ſinnes moſt common in this Realme, we require of your Honours in the name of the eternall God, that ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according as God hath commanded, be executed againſt ſuch wicked contemners. For we doubt not, but ſuch enormities and crimes openly committed, provoke the wrath of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, not onely upon the offenders, but upon ſuch places, where without puniſhment they are committed. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our former purpoſe, Marriage ought not to be contracted amongſt perſons, that have no election for lack of underſtanding. And therefore we affirme that bairns and infants cannot lawfully be married in their minor age, to wit, the man within 14. yeares, and the woman 12. years at leaſt. Which if it have been, and they have kept themſelves alwayes ſeparate, we cannot judge them to adhere, as men &amp; wives, by reaſon of that promiſe which in Gods preſence was no promiſe at all: but if in yeares of judgement they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95701:41"/>have embraced the one the other, then by reaſon of that laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they have ratified that which others have permitted for them in their youth-head.</p>
               <p>In a reformed Kirk Marriage ought not to be ſecretly uſed but in open face, and publick audience of the Kirk, and for avoiding of dangers, expedient it is, that the band be publickly proclaimed 3. Sundayes, unleſſe the perſons be ſo knowne, that no ſuſpition of danger may ariſe: and then may the time be ſhortned at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the miniſtrie. But no wayes can we admit marriage to be uſed ſecretly, how honourable ſoever the perſons be. The Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before noon we think moſt expedient for marriage, &amp; it be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no dayelſe, without the conſent of the whole miniſtery. Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age once lawfully contracted, may not be diſſolved at mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as our maſter Chriſt Jeſus doth witnes, unleſſe adulterie be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted; which being ſufficiently proved in preſence of the civill Magiſtrate, the innocent (if they ſo require) ought to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced free, and the offender ought to ſuffer death, as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. If the civill ſword fooliſhly ſpare the life of the offender, yet may not the Kirke be negligent in their office, which is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the wicked, and to repute them as dead members, &amp; to pronounce the innocent party to be at freedome, be they never ſo honourable before the world. If the life be ſpared, as it ought not to be to the offenders, &amp; if fruits of repentance of long time appeare in them, and if they earneſtly deſire to be reconciled with the Kirk, we judge they may be received to the participation of the Sacraments, and other benefits of the Kirk. For we would not that the Kirk ſhould hold them excommunicate, whom God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that is the penitent. If any demand whether that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after reconciliation with the Kirk, may not marry againe, We anſwer, that if they cannot live continently, and if the neceſſity be ſuch, as that they feare further offence of God, we cannot forbid them to uſe the remedy ordained of God. If the party offended, may be reconciled to the offender, then wee judge that on no wayes it ſhall be lawfull to the offender to marry any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except the party that before hath been offended; and the ſolemnization of the latter marriage muſt be in the open face of the Kirk, like as the former, but without proclamation of bands.</p>
               <p>This we do offer as the beſt counſell that God giveth unto us in ſo doubt ſome a caſe, but the moſt perfect reformation were, if
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95701:42"/>your Honours would give to God his honour and glory, that yee would preferre his expreſſe commandement to your own corrupt judgments, eſpecially in puniſhing of theſe crimes, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to be puniſhed with death. For ſo ſhould yee declare your ſelves Gods true obedient officiars, and your common-wealth ſhould be rid of innumerable troubles.</p>
               <p>We meane not that ſinnes committed in our former blindneſſe (which be almoſt buried in oblivion) ſhall be called again to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and judgement. But we require that the law may be now, and hereafter ſo eſtabliſhed and execute, that this ungodly impunity of finne have no place within this Realme. For in the feare of God we ſignifie unto your Honours, that whoſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades you that ye may pardon where God commandeth death, deceives your ſoules, and provokes you to offend Gods Majeſtie.</p>

               <head>Of Buriall.</head>
               <p>BUriall in all ages hath beene holden in eſtimation to ſignifie that the ſame body which was committed to the earth ſhould not utterly periſh, but ſhould riſe againe, and the ſame we would have kept within this Realme. Provided that ſuperſtition, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and whatſoever hath proceeded of a falſe opinion, and for advantage ſake, may be avoided, and ſinging of Maſſe, <hi>placebo</hi> and <hi>dirige,</hi> and all other prayers over, or for the dead, which are not onely ſuperſtitious and vaine, but alſo are idolatry, and doe repugne to the plaine Scriptures of God. For plaine it is, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that dyeth, departeth either in the faith of Chriſt Jeſus, or departeth in incredulity. Plaine it is, that they that depart in the true faith of Chriſt Jeſus reſt from their labours, and from death doe goe to life everlaſting, as by our Maſter and his Apoſtles we are taught. But whoſoever departeth in unbeliefe, or in incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſhall never ſee life, but the wrath of God abides upon him. And ſo we ſay, that prayers for the dead are not onely ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and vaine, but doe expreſly repugne to the manifeſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and veritie thereof. For avoiding of all inconveniences we judge it beſt, that neither ſinging, nor reading be at buriall? For albeit things ſung and read may admoniſh ſome of the living to prepare themſelves for death, yet ſhall ſome ſuperſtitious think that ſinging and reading of the living may profit the dead. And therfore we think it moſt expedient, that the dead be conveyed to the place of buriall with ſome honeſt company of the Kirk, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either ſinging or reading; yea, without all kind of ceremony
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95701:42"/>heretofore uſed, other then that the dead be committed to the grave, with ſuch gravity and ſobriety, as thoſe that be preſent may ſeeme to feare the judgements of God, and to hate ſinne which is the cauſe of death.</p>
               <p>We are not ignorant, that ſome require a Sermon at the buriall, or elſe ſome place of Scripture to be read, to put the living in minde that they are mortall, and that likewiſe they muſt die. But let theſe men underſtand, that the Sermons which be daily made ſerve for that uſe; which if men deſpiſe, the funerall Sermons ſhall rather nouriſh ſuperſtition and a falſe opinion, as before is ſaid, then that they ſhall bring ſuch perſons to a godly conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own eſtate. Attour either ſhall the Miniſters for the moſt part be occupied in funerall Sermons, or elſe they ſhall have reſpect of perſons, preaching at the burials of the rich and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but keeping ſilence when the poore and deſpiſed departeth; and this with ſafe conſcience cannot the Miniſter doe. For ſeeing that before God there is no reſpect of perſons, and that their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie appertaineth to all alike, whatſoever they doe to the rich in reſpect of their Miniſtrie, the ſame they are bound to doe to the pooreſt under their charge. In reſpect of divers inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we think it neither ſeemly that the Kirk appointed to prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and miniſtration of the Sacraments ſhall be made a place of buriall, but that ſome other ſecret and convenient place, lying in the moſt free aire, be appointed for that uſe, which place ought to be walled and fenced about, and kept for that uſe onely.</p>

               <p>LEſt that the word of God, and miniſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by unſeemlineſſe of the place come in contempt, of neceſſity it is that the Kirk and place where the people ought publickly to convene be with expedition repaired with doores, windowes, thack, and with ſuch preparation within, as appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as well to the Majeſtie of God, as unto the eaſe and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the people.

               <p>AS Satan hath never ceaſed from the beginning, to draw man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in one of two extremities, to wit, that men ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their be ſo raviſhed with gazing upon the viſible creatures, that forgetting the cauſe wherefore they are ordained, they attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them a vertue and power, which God hath not granted unto them: or elſe that men ſhould ſo contemn and deſpiſe Gods bleſſed Ordinance, and holy inſtitutions, as if that neither in the right uſe of them there were any profit, neither yet in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanations there were any danger. As this way, we ſay Satan hath blinded the moſt part of mankinde from the beginning: ſo doubt we not, but that he will ſtrive to continue in his malice even to the end. Our eyes have ſeen, and preſently doe ſee the experience of the one, and of the other. What was the opinion of the moſt part of men, of the Sacrament of Chriſts body and bloud, during the darkneſſe of ſuperſtition, is not unknowne. How it was gazed upon, kneeled unto, born in proceſſion, and finally worſhipped &amp; honoured as Chriſt Jeſus himſelfe. And ſo long at Satan might then retaine men in that damnable idolatrie, he was quiet, as one that poſſeſſed his kingdome of darknes peaceably. But ſince that it hath pleaſed the mercies of God to reveale unto the unthankfull world the light of his Word, the right uſe and adminiſtration of his Sacraments, he aſſayes man upon the contrary part. For where not long agoe men ſtood in ſuch admiration of that idol the Maſſe, that none durſt have preſumed to have ſaid the Maſſe, but the ſhaven ſort, the beaſts marked men; ſome dare now be ſo bold as without all vocation to miniſter, as they ſuppoſe, the true Sacraments in open Aſſemblies: and ſome idiots (yet more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and impudently) dare counterfeit in their houſe, that which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95701:43"/>the true Miniſters doe in the open Congregations. They preſume we ſay, to doe it in houſes, without reverence, without Word Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and without Miniſter. This contempt proceeds, no doubt, from the malice and craft of that Serpent, who firſt deceived man, of purpoſe to deface the glory of Chriſts Evangell, and to bring his bleſſed Sacraments in a perpetuall contempt: And further, your Honors may cleerly ſee, how ſtubbornly and proudly the moſt part deſpiſes the Evangell of Chriſt Jeſus offered unto you, whom unleſſe that ſharply and ſtoutly ye reſiſt, we mean as well the manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer, as the prophaner of the Sacraments, ye ſhall finde them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious enemies ere it be long. And therefore in the Name of the Eternall God, and of his Son Chriſt Ieſus, we require of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, that without delay, ſtrait Lawes be made againſt the one, and the other.</p>
               <p>We dare not preſcribe unto you, what penalties ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſuch: But this we feare not to affirme, that the one and the other deſerve death. For if he who doth falſifie the ſeale, ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or coine of a King, is judged worthy of death, what ſhall we thinke of him who plainly doth falſifie the Seales of Chriſt Jeſus, Prince of the Kings of the earth? If <hi>Darius</hi> pronounced that a balk ſhould be taken from the houſe of that man, and he himſelf hanged upon it, that durſt attempt to hinder the re-edifying of the materiall Temple, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly blaſpheme God, and manifeſtly hinder the Temple of God, which is the ſoules and bodies of the elect to be purged by the true Preaching of Chriſt Jeſus, from the ſuperſtition and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Idolatry, in which they have been long plunged, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den captive? If ye, as God forbid, declare your ſelves careleſſe over the true Religion, God will not ſuffer your negligence unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: and therefore more earneſtly we require that ſtrait Lawes may be made againſt the ſtubborne contemners of Chriſt Ieſus, and againſt ſuch as dare preſume to miniſter his Sacraments, not orderly called to that Office, leaſt while that there be none found to gainſtand impietie, the wrath of God be kindled againſt the whole.</p>
               <p>The Papiſticall Prieſts have neither power, nor authoritie to miniſter the Sacraments of Chriſt Jeſus, becauſe that in their mouth is not the Sermon of exhortation: and therefore to them muſt ſtrait Inhibition be made, notwithſtanding any uſurpation they have had in the time of blindneſſe. It is neither the clipping
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95701:44"/>of their crownes, the greaſing of their fingers, not the blowing of the dumbe dogges, called the Biſhops, neither the laying on of their hands, that maketh Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus. But the Spirit of God inwardly firſt moving the hearts to ſeek Chriſts glory, and the profit of his Kirk, and thereafter the nomination of the people, the examination of the learned, and publike admiſſion (as before is ſaid) make men lawfull Miniſters of the Word, and Sacraments. We ſpeak of an ordinary vocation; and not of that which is extraordinary, when God by himſelfe, and by his onely power, raiſeth up to the Miniſtery ſuch as beſt pleaſeth his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

               <p>THUS have we in theſe few heads offered unto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors our judgements, according as we were commanded, touching the reformation of things, which heretofore have altogether been abuſed in this curſed Papiſtrie. We doubt not but ſome of our petitions ſhall appeare ſtrange unto you at the firſt fight. But if your wiſedomes deeply conſider, that we muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere not only unto man, but alſo before the throne of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, and of his Son Chriſt Ieſus, for the counſell which we give in this ſo grave a matter, your Honors ſhall eaſily conſider, that more aſſured it is to us to fall in the diſpleaſure of all men in the earth, then to offend the Majeſtie of God, whoſe juſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer flatterers, and deceitfull counſellors unpuniſhed. That we require the Kirk to be ſet at ſuch liberty, that ſhe neither be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to feed Idle-bellies, neither yet to ſuſtaine the tyrannie which heretofore hath been by violence maintained: wee know we ſhall offend many, but if we ſhould keep filence hereof, wee are moſt aſſured to offend the juſt and Righteous God, who by the mouth of his Apoſtle hath pronounced this ſentence, <hi>He that labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, let him not eat.</hi> If we in this behalfe, or in any other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or aske any other thing then by Gods expreſſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by equity and good conſcience ye are bound to grant, let it be noted, and after repudiate. But if wee require nothing which God requireth not alſo, let your Honors take heed how we gaineſtand the charge of him, whoſe hand and puniſhment yee cannot eſcape. If blinde affections rather lead you to have reſpect to the ſuſtentation of theſe your carnall friends, who tyranouſly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95701:44"/>have impyred above the flock of Chriſt Ieſus, then that the zeale of Chriſt Ieſus his glory provoke and move you to ſet his oppreſſed Kirk at freedome and libertie, wee feare your ſharpe and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine puniſhments, and that the glory and honor of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe be reſerved unto others. And yet ſhall this our judgement abide to the generations following, for a monument and witneſſe how lovingly God called you, and this nation to Repentance: what counſellours God ſent unto you, and how you have uſed the ſame. If obediently ye heare God now calling, we doubt not but he ſhall heare you in your greateſt neceſſitie. But if, following your owne corrupt judgements, ye contemne his voice and vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we are aſſured that your former iniquitie, and preſent ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſhall together crave great puniſhment from God, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long delay to execute his moſt juſt judgements, when after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offences, and long blindneſſe, grace and mercy offered is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly refuſed.</p>

And ſo ſtrengthen you by the Spirit of Fortitude, that boldly yee may puniſh vice, and maintaine vertue within this Realme, to the praiſe and glory of his holy Name, to the comfort and aſſurance of your own conſciences, and to the conſolation, and the good example of the poſterity following, Amen.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Kirk and policie thereof in generall, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is different from the civill policie.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Kirk of God ſometimes is largely taken, for all them that profeſſe the Evangell of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo it is a company and fellowſhip not onely of the godly, but alſo of hypocrites, profeſſing alwayes outwardly the true Religion.</p>
               <p>Other times it is taken for the Godly and Elect only, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for them that exerciſe ſpirituall function in the congregation of them that profeſſe the truth.</p>
               <p>The Kirk in this laſt ſenſe, hath a certain power granted by God, according to which it uſes a proper juriſdiction and government, exerciſed to the comfort of the whole Kirk.</p>
               <p>This power Eccleſiaſticall is an authoritie granted by God the Father, through the Mediator Ieſus Chriſt, unto his Kirke gathered, and having the ground in the Word of God to be put in execution by them, unto whom the ſpirituall government of the Kirk by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling is committed.</p>
               <p>The Policie of the Kirk flowing from this power, is an order or forme of ſpirituall government, which is exerciſed by the members appointed thereto by the Word of God: and therefore is given imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the office-bearers, by whom it is exerciſed to the weale of the whole body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:95701:46"/>
This power is diverſly uſed: for ſometime it is ſeverally exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, chiefly by the teachers; ſometime conjunctly by mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of them that bear the office and charge, after the form of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The former is onely called <hi>poteſtas ordinis,</hi> and the other <hi>poteſtas juriſdictionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two kinds of power have both one authority, one ground, one finall cauſe, but are different in the manner, and forme of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as is evident by the ſpeaking of our Maſter in the 16 and 18 of Matthew.</p>
               <p>This power and policy Eccleſiaſticall is different and diſtinct in the own nature from that power and policy which is called Civill power, and appertaineth to the Civill government of the Common wealth; albeit they be both of God, and tend to one end, if they be rightly uſed, viz. to advance the glory of God, and to have godly and good ſubjects.</p>
               <p>For this power Eccleſiaſticall floweth immediately from God, and the mediator Jeſus Chriſt, and is ſpirituall, not having a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall head in the earth, but only Chriſt, the only ſpirituall King and governour of his Kirk.</p>
               <p>It is a title falſly uſurped by Antichriſt, to call himſelf head of the Kirk, and ought not to be attributed to Angel, nor man, of what eſtate that ever he be, ſaving to Chriſt the onely head and Monarch in the Kirk.</p>
               <p>Therefore this power and policy of the Kirk ſhould leane upon the word immediatly, as the onely ground thereof, and ſhould be taken from the pure fountains of the ſcriptures, the Kirk hearing the voice of Chriſt the only ſpirituall King, and being ruled by his laws.</p>
               <p>It is proper to Kings, Princes and Magiſtrates to be called Lords, and dominators over their ſubjects whom they govern civilly, but it is proper to Chriſt onely to be called Lord and Maſter in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall government of the Kirk; and all others that bear office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ought not to uſurp dominion therein, nor be called Lords, but only Miniſters, Diſciples, and ſervants. For it is Chriſts proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to command and rule his Kirk univerſally, and every particular Kirk through his ſpirit and word, by the miniſtery of men.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, as the Miniſters and others of the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate are ſubject to the Magiſtrate civill, ſo ought the perſon of the Magiſtrate be ſubject to the Kirk ſpiritually, and in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall government. And the exerciſe of both theſe juriſdictions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand in one perſon ordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:95701:46"/>
The Civill power is called the power of the Sword, and the other the power of the Keys.</p>
               <p>The civill power ſhould command the ſpirituall to exerciſe, and to doe their office according to the word of God; The ſpirituall rulers ſhould require the Chriſtian magiſtrate to miniſter juſtice, and puniſh vice, and to maintaine the liberty and quietnes of the Kirk within their bounds</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate commandeth externall things for externall peace and quietneſſe amongſt the ſubjects: the Miniſter handleth exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things onely for conſcience cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate handleth externall things only, and actions done before men, but the ſpirituall ruler judgeth both inward affections, and externall actions in reſpect of conſcience, by the word of God.</p>
               <p>The Civill Magiſtrate craves and gets obedience by the ſword, and other externall meanes, but the Miniſtery by the ſpirituall ſword, and ſpirituall means.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate neither ought to preach, miniſter the ſacraments, nor execute the cenſures of the Kirk, nor yet preſcribe any rule how it ſhould be done, but command the Miniſters to obſerve the rule commanded in the word, and puniſh the tranſgreſſors by Civill meanes. The Miniſters exerce not the Civill juriſdiction, but teach the Magiſtrate how it ſhould bee exerciſed according to the word.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate ought to aſſiſt, maintaine and fortifie the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Kirk. The Miniſters ſhould aſſiſt their Princes in all things agreeable to the word, providing they neglect not their own charge by involving themſelves in civill affaires.</p>
               <p>Finally, as Miniſters are ſubject to the judgement and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magiſtrate in externall things, if they offend: ſo ought the Magiſtrates to ſubmit themſelves to the diſcipline of the Kirk, if they tranſgreſſe in matters of Conſcience and Religion.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Policie of the Kirk, and perſons and office-bearers, to whom the adminiſtration is committed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS in the civill policy the whole Commonweale conſiſteth in them that are governors, or Magiſtrates, and them that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, or ſubjects: So in the policy of the Kirk ſome are appointed to be rulers, and the reſt of the members thereof to be ruled, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95701:47"/>obey according to the word of God, and inſpiration of his ſpirit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes under one head and chiefe governour, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, the whole policy of the Kirk conſiſteth in three things, in Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Diſtribution. With Doctrine is annexed the adminiſtration of Sacraments: and according to the parts of this diviſion, ariſeth a ſort of threefold officers in the Kirk, to wit, of Miniſters Preachers, Elders Governours, and Deacons diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And all theſe may be called by a generall word, Miniſters of the Kirk. For albeit the Kirk of God be ruled and governed by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who is the only King, high Prieſt, and head thereof, yet he uſeth the miniſtery of men, as the moſt neceſſary middes for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For ſo he hath from time to time, before the Law, under the Law, and in the time of the Evangell for our great comfort raiſed us men indued with the gifts of the ſpirit, for the ſpirituall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kirk, exerciſing by them his own power, through his ſpirit and word to the building of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And to take away all occaſion of tyranny, he will that they ſhould rule with mutuall conſent of brether, and equality of power, every one according to their functions.</p>
               <p>In the new Teſtament, and time of the Evangell, he hath uſed the Miniſtery of the Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Doctors in adminiſtration of the word: The Elderſhip for good order, and adminiſtration of the Diſcipline: The Deaconſhip to have the cure of the Eccleſiaſticall goods.</p>
               <p>Some of their Eccleſiaſticall function are ordinary, and ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary or temporary. There be three extraordinary functions; The office of the Apoſtle, the Evangeliſt and of the Prophet, which are not perpetuall, and now have ceaſed in the Kirk of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when it pleaſed God extraordinarily for a time to ſtirre ſome of them up againe.</p>
               <p>There are foure ordinary functions or offices in the Kirk of God, the office of the paſtor, Miniſter or Biſhop, the Doctor, Presbyter or Elder, and the Deacon.</p>
               <p>Their offices are ordinary, and ought to continue perpetually in the Kirk, as neceſſary for the government and policy thereof, and no more offices ought to be received or ſuffered in the Kirk of God, eſtabliſhed according to his word.</p>
               <p>Therefore all the ambitious titles invented in the kingdome of Antichriſt, and in his uſurped Hierarchy, which are not of one of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95701:47"/>theſe ſoure ſorts, together with the offices depending thereupon, in one word ought to be rejected.</p>

            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>How the perſons that bear Eccleſiaſticall function, are to be admitted to their office.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>VOcation or calling is common to all that ſhould beare office within the Kirk, which is a lawfull way, by the which quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons are promoted to any ſpirituall office within the Kirk of God.</p>
               <p>Without this lawfull calling it was never leaſome to any perſon to meddle with any function Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Calling, one extraordinary by God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as was of the Prophets and Apoſtles, which in Kirks eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and well already reformed hath no place.</p>
               <p>The other calling is ordinary, which beſides the calling of God, and inward teſtimony of a good conſcience, is the lawfull approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and outward judgement of men, according to Gods word, and order eſtabliſhed in his Kirk.</p>
               <p>None ought to preſume to enter in any office Eccleſiaſticall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this good teſtimony before God, who onely knows the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>This ordinary and outward calling hath two parts, election and ordination. Election is the chooſing out of a perſon, or perſons, moſt able, to the office that vakes, by the judgement of the Elderſhip, and conſent of the Congregation, to which ſhall be the perſon, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons appointed.</p>
               <p>The qualities in generall requiſite in all them, who ſhould beare charge in the Kirk, conſiſt in ſoundneſſe of Religion, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, according as they are ſufficiently ſet forth in the Word.</p>
               <p>In the order of Election it is to be eſchewed, that any perſon be intruded in any offices of the Kirk, contrary to the will of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to which they are appointed, or without the volce of the Elderſhip.</p>
               <p>None ought to be intruded, or placed in the placea already plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or in any room that vakes not, for any worldly reſpect: and that which is called the benefice ought to be nothing elſe, but the ſtipend of the Miniſters that are lawfully called.</p>
               <p>Ordination is the ſeparation and ſanctifying of the perſon appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God and his Kirk, after he be well tried and found qualified.</p>

               <p>The Ceremonies of Ordination are faſting, earneſt Prayer, and impoſition of hands of the Elderſhip.</p>
               <p>All thir, as they muſt be raiſed up by God, and by him made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the work whereto they are called; ſo ought they know their meſſage to be limited within Gods word, without the bounds of the which they ought not to paſſe.</p>
               <p>All thir ſhould take theſe titles and names onely (leſt they be exalted and puft up in themſelves) which the Scriptures gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as theſe which import labour, travell and work, and are names of offices and ſervice, and not of idleneſſe, dignity, worldly honour or preheminence, which by Chriſt our Maſter is expreſly reproved and forbidden.</p>
               <p>All theſe office-bearers ſhould have their own particular flocks amongſt whom they exerciſe their charge.</p>
               <p>All ſhould make refidence with them, and take the inſpection and overfight of them, every one in his vocation.</p>
               <p>And generally thir twa things ought they all to reſpect: the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and edifying of his kirk, in diſcharging their duties in their calling.</p>

               <p>PAſtors, Biſhops, or Miniſters, are they who are appointed to particular Congregations, which they rule by the word of God and over the which they watch. In reſpect whereof ſometime they are called Paſtors, becauſe they feed their Congregation; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>Epiſcopi,</hi> or Biſhops, becauſe they watch above their flock; ſometimes Miniſters, by reaſon of their ſervice and office, and ſometimes alſo Presbyters or Seniors, for the gravity in manners which they ought to have in taking care of the ſpirituall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ought to be moſt deare unto them.</p>
               <p>They that are called unto the Miniſtery, or that offer themſelves thereunto, ought not to be elected without any certain flock be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned unto them.</p>
               <p>No man ought to ingyre himſelfe, or uſurpe his office without lawfull calling.</p>
               <p>They who are once called by God, and duely elected by man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they have once accepted the charge of Miniſtery, may not leave their functions.</p>
               <p>

The deſertours ſhould be admoniſhed, and in caſe of obſtinacy, finally, Excommunicate.</p>
               <p>No Paſtor may leave his flock without Licenſe of the Provinciall or Nationall Aſſembly, which if he doe, after admonitions not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, let the cenſures of the Kirk ſtrike upon him.</p>
               <p>Unto the Paſtors apperteins teaching of the Word of God, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, publikly and privately, alwaies travelling to edifie, and diſcharge his conſcience, as Gods word preſcribes to him.</p>
               <p>Unto the Paſtors onely apperteins the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, in like manner as the adminiſtration of the Word: For both are appointed by God, as meanes to teach us, the one by the care, and the other by the eyes, and other ſenſes, that by both, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be transferred to the minde.</p>
               <p>It appertains by the ſame reaſon to the Paſtor to pray for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and namely, for the flock committed to his charge, and to bleſſe them in the name of the Lord, who will not ſuffer the bleſſings of his faithfull ſervants to be fruſtrate.</p>
               <p>He ought alſo to watch above the manners of his flock, that the better he may apply the Doctrine to them in reprehending the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perſons, and exhorting the godly to continue in the feare of the Lord.</p>
               <p>It appertains to the Miniſter after lawfull proceeding by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, to pronounce the ſentence of binding and looſing upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon, according unto the power of the keys granted unto the Kirk.</p>
               <p>It belongs to him likewiſe, after lawfull proceeding in the matter by the Elderſhip, to ſolemnizate mariage betwixt them, that are to be joyned therein, and to pronounce the bleſſing of the Lord upon them that enter in at that holy Band in the feare of God.</p>
               <p>And generally all publick denunciations that are to be made in the Kirk before the Congregation concerning the Eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires belonging to the Office of a Miniſter: For he is as meſſenger and Herauld betwixt God and the people in all theſe affaires.</p>

               <p>ONE of the two ordinary and perpetuall functions that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in the Word, is the Office of the Doctor, who may be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95701:50"/>alſo called Prophet, Biſhop, Elder, Catechiſer, that is, teacher of the Catechiſme, and rudiments of Religion.</p>
               <p>His office is to open up the minde of the Spirit of God in the Scriptures ſimply, without ſuch applications as the Miniſters uſe, to the end that the faithfull may be inſtructed, and ſound Doctrine taught, and that the purity of the Goſpell be not corrupted through ignorance, or evill opinions.</p>
               <p>He is different from the Paſtor, not only in name, but in diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of gifts. For to the Doctor is given the word of knowledge, to open up by ſimple teaching the myſteries of faith; to the Paſtor the gift of wiſdome, to apply the ſame by exhortation to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the flock, as occaſion craveth.</p>
               <p>Under the name and office of a Doctor wee comprehend alſo the order in Schooles, Colledges, and Univerſities, which hath been from time to time carefully maintained, as well among the Jewes and Chriſtians, as alſo among the prophane Nations.</p>
               <p>The Doctor being an Elder, as is ſaid, ſhould aſſiſt the Paſtor in the government of the Kirk, and concurre with the Elders his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in all aſſemblies; by reaſon the interpretation of the Word, which is onely judge in Eccleſiaſticall matters, is committed to his charge.</p>
               <p>But to preach unto the people, to Miniſter the Sacraments, and to celebrate mariages, pertaine not to the Doctor, unleſſe he be otherwiſe called ordinarily: howbeit the Paſtor may teach in the Schooles, as he who hath the gift of knowledge, oftentimes meet for that end, as the examples of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and others teſtifie, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>In this our diviſion, we call theſe Elders, whom the Apoſtles call Preſidents or Governours. Their office as it is ordinary, ſo is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and alwayes neceſſary in the Kirk of God. The Elderſhip is a ſpirituall function, as is the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>Elders once lawfully called to the office, and having gifts from God meet to exerciſe the ſame, may not leave it again. Albeit ſuch a number of Elders may be choſen in certaine Congregations, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95701:50"/>one part of them may relieve another for a reaſonable ſpace, as was among the Levites under the Law in ſerving of the Temple.</p>
               <p>The number of the Elders in every Congregation cannot well be limited, but ſhould be according to the bounds and neceſſity of the people.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary that all Elders be alſo teachers of the Word, albeit the chiefe ought to be ſuch and ſwa are worthy of double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</p>
               <p>What manner of perſons they ought to be, we referre it to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word, and namely the Canons written by the Apoſtle Paul.</p>
               <p>Their office is as well ſeverally, as conjunctly, to watch diligently upon the flock committed to their charge, both publikely, and privately, that no corruption of Religion, or manners, enter therein.</p>
               <p>As the Paſtors and Doctors ſhould be diligent in teaching and ſowing the ſeed of the Word, ſo the Elders ſhould be carefull in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the fruit of the ſame in the people.</p>
               <p>It appertains to them to aſſiſt the Paſtor in examination of them that come to the Lords Table: item, in viſiting the ſick.</p>
               <p>They ſhould cauſe the acts of the aſſemblies, as well particular as generall to be put in execution carefully.</p>
               <p>They ſhould be diligent in admoniſhing all men of their duty according to the rule of the Evangell.</p>
               <p>Things that they cannot correct by private admonitions they ſhould bring to the Elderſhip.</p>
               <p>Their principall office is to hold Aſſemblies with the Paſiors and Doctors who are alſo of their number, for eſtabliſhing of good order and execution of Diſcipline, unto the which Aſſemblies all perſons are ſubject that remain within their bounds.</p>

               <p>All the Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies have power to convene lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together for treating of things concerning the Kirk, and pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their charge.</p>
               <p>They have power to appoint times, and places to that effect, and at one meeting to appoint the dyet, time and place for another.</p>
               <p>In all Aſſemblies an Moderatour ſhould be choſen by common conſent of the whole brethren convened, who ſhould propone matters, gather the votes, and cauſe good order to be kept in aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>Diligence ſhould be taken, chiefly by the Moderator, that onely Eccleſiaſticall things be handled in the aſſemblies, and that there be no medling with any thing pertaining to the civill juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Every Aſſembly hath power to ſend forth from them of their own number, ane or moe viſitours to ſee how all things be ruled in the bounds of their juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Viſitation of moe Kirks is no ordinary Office Eccleſiaſtick in the perſon of one man, neither may the name of a Biſhop be attribute to the viſitor onely, neither is it neceſſary to abide alwayes in one mans perſon, but it is the part of the Elderſhip to ſend out qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to viſit <hi>prore nata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The finall end of aſſemblies is firſt to keep the Religion and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in purity without error and corruption. Next, to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and good order in the Kirk.</p>
               <p>For this orders cauſe, they may make certaine rules and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appertaining to the good behaviours of all the members of the kirk in their vocation.</p>
               <p>They have power alſo to abrogate and aboliſh all Statutes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances concerning Eccleſiſticall matters, that are found noyſome and unprofitable, and agree not with the time, or are abuſed by the people.</p>
               <p>They have power to execute Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon all tranſgreſſors, and proud contemners of the good order and policy of the Kirk, and ſo the whole Diſcipline is in their hands.</p>
               <p>The firſt kinde and ſort of aſſemblies, although they be within par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, yet they exerce the power, authority and Juriſdiction of the Kirk with mutuall conſent, and therefore beare ſometime the name of the Kirk.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:95701:53"/>
When we ſpeake of the Elders of the particular Congregations, we mean not that every particular Pariſh-kirk can or may have their own particular Elderſhips, ſpecially in Landward; but we thinke three, foure, moe or fewer particular kirks may have one Elderſhip common to them all, to judge their Eccleſiaſticall cauſes.</p>
               <p>Yet this is meet, That ſome of the Elders be choſen out of every particular Congregation, to concur with the reſt of their brethren in the common Aſſembly, and to take up the delations of offences within their own kirks, and bring them to the Aſſembly. This we gather of the practiſe of the Primitive kirke, where Elders, or Colledges of Seniors were conſtitute in Cities, and famous places.</p>
               <p>The power of their particular Elderſhips is to uſe diligent labors in the bounds committed to their charge, that the kirks be kept in good order, to inquire diligently in naughty &amp; unruly perſons, and travell to bring them in the way againe, either by admonition or threatning of Gods judgements, or by correction.</p>
               <p>It pertaines to the Elderſhip to take heed that the word of God be purely preached within their bounds, the Sacraments rightly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, the Diſcipline rightly maintained, and the Ecclefiaſticall goods uncorruptly diſtributed.</p>
               <p>It belongs to this kind of Aſſembly, to cauſe the ordinances made by the Aſſemblies provinciall, nationall, and generall, to be kept and put in execution.</p>
               <p>To make conſtitutions which concerne <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the kirk, for the decent order of theſe particular kirks where they govern: Providing, they alter no rules made by generall or provinciall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and that they make the provinciall Aſſemblies fore-ſeen of theſe rules that they ſhall make, and aboliſh them that tend to the hurt of the ſame.</p>
               <p>It hath power to excommunicate the obſtinate.</p>
               <p>The power of election of them who beare Eccleſiaſticall charges pertaines to this kinde of Aſſembly within their own bounds, being well erected, and conſtitute of many Paſtors and Elders of ſufficient abilitie.</p>
               <p>By the like reaſon their depoſition alſo pertaines to this kinde of Aſſembly: as of them that teach erronious and corrupt Doctrine, that be of ſlanderous life, and after admonition deſiſt not; that be given to ſchiſme or rebellion againſt the kirk, manifeſt blaſphemy, fimony, corruption of bribes, falſhood, perjury, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95701:54"/>theft, drunkenneſſe, fighting worthy of puniſhment by the Law, uſury, dancing, infamy, and all others, that deſerve ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the kirk.</p>
               <p>Theſe alſo who are altogether found unſufficient to execute their charge ſhould be depoſed, whereof other kirks would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed that they receive not the perſons depoſed.</p>
               <p>Yet they ought not to be depoſed, who through age, fickeneſſe, or other accidents become unmeet to do their office, in which caſe their honour ſhould remaine to them, their kirk ſhould maintaine them; and others ought to be provided to doe their office.</p>
               <p>Provinciall aſſembles we call lawfull conventions of Paſtors, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and other Elders of a Province, gathered for the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the kirk thereof, which alſo may be called the conference of the kirk and brethren.</p>
               <p>Their aſſembles are inſtitute for weighty matters to be intreated by mutuall conſent and aſſiſtance of the brethren within that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as need requires.</p>
               <p>This aſſembly hath power to handle, order, and redreſſe all things committed or done amiſſe in the particular aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>It hath power to depoſe the office-bearers of that province for good and juſt cauſes deſerving deprivation.</p>
               <p>And generally their aſſemblies have the whole power of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Elderſhips whereof they are collected.</p>
               <p>The Nationall aſſembly, which is generall to us, is a lawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the whole kirks of the Realm or Nation where it is uſed and gathered, for the common affaires of the kirk, and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the generall Elderſhip of the whol kirks in the Realm. None are ſubject to repaire to this aſſembly to vote, but Ecclefiaſticall perſons to ſuch a number, as ſhall be thought good by the ſame Aſſembly, not excluding other perſons that will repaire to the ſaid Aſſembly to propone, hear, and reaſon.</p>
               <p>This Aſſembly is inſtitute, that all things either committed, or done amiſſe in the Provinciall Aſſemblies may be redreſſed and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and things generally ſerving for the weale of the whole body of the kirk within the Realm may be foreſcen, intreated and ſet forth to Gods glory.</p>
               <p>It ſhould take care, that kirks be planted in places where they are not planted.</p>
               <p>It ſhould preſcribe the rule how the other two kindes of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ſhould proceed in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95701:54"/>
This Aſſembly ſhould take heed, that the ſpirituall juriſdiction, and civill, be not confounded to the hurt of the kirk; That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the kirk be not conſumed, nor abuſed; and generally concerning all weighty affaires that concern the weale and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the whole Kirks of the Realm, it ought to interpone autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereto.</p>
               <p>There is beſides theſe, another more generall kinde of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, which is of all Nations, and all eſtates of perſons within the kirk, repreſenting the univerſall kirk of Chriſt, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led properly the Generall Aſſembly, or Generall Councell of the kirk of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe Aſſemblies were appointed and called together ſpecially, when any great ſchiſme or controverſie in Doctrine did ariſe in the kirk, and were convocate atcommand of godly Emperours being for the time, for avoiding of ſchiſme within the Univerſall kirk of God, which becauſe they pertain not to the particular eſtate of any Realm we ceaſe further to ſpeak of them.</p>

               <p>To take any of this Patrimony by unlawfull means, and convert it to the particular and prophane uſe of any perſon, we hold it a deteſtatable ſacriledge before God.</p>

To make lawes and conſtitutions agreeable to Gods word, for advancement of the Kirk, and policie thereof, without uſurping any thing that pertains not to the civil ſword, but belongs to the offices that are meerly Eccleſiaſticall, as is the miniſterie of the Word and Sacraments, uſing Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, and the ſpirituall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, or any part of the power of the ſpirituall keys, which our Maſter gave to the Apoſtles, and their true ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>And although Kings and Princes that be Godly, ſometimes by their owne authority, when the Kirk is corrupted, and all things out of order, place Miniſters, and reſtore the true ſervice of the Lord, after the example of ſome godly Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> and divers godly Empeours, and Kings alſo in the light of the new Teſtament.

               <p>AS it is the duty of the godly Magiſtrate to maintaine the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent libertie, which God hath granted by the Preaching of his Word, and the true adminiſtration of the Sacraments within this Realme: So is it to provide, that all abuſes which yet remaine in the Kirk, be removed, and utterly taken away.</p>
               <p>Therefore, firſt the admiſſion of men to papiſticall titles of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſuch as ſerve not, nor have no function in the Reformed Kirk of Chriſt, as Abbotes, Commendators, Priors, Prioreſſes, and other titles of Abbeys, whoſe places are now for the moſt part by the juſt judgement of God demoliſhed, and purged of idolatry, is plain abuſe, and is not to receive the Kingdome of Chriſt amongſt us, but rather to refuſe it.</p>
               <p>Such like that they that of old were called the Chapiters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Abbeys, Cathedrall kirks, and like places, ſerve for nothing now, but to ſet fewes and tacks, if any thing be left of the kirk lands and teinds, in hurt and prejudice thereof, as daily experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and therefore ought to be utterly abrogate and aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Of the like nature are the Deanes, Archdeacons, Chantours, Subchantours, Theſaurers, Chancellors and others having the like titles flowing from the Pope and Canon law onely, who have no place in the reformed kirk.</p>

               <p>Neither ought ſuch abuſers of the kirks Patrimony to have vote in Parliament, nor ſit in Councell under the name of the kirk and kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to the hurt and prejudice of the libertie thereof, and laws of the Realme made in favour of the Reformed kirk.</p>
               <p>Much leſſe is it lawfull, that any perſon amongſt theſe men ſhould have five, ſixteen, twenty or moe kirks, all craving the charge of ſouls, and bruike the patrimony thereof, either by admiſſion of the Prince, or of the kirk, in this light of the Evangell. For it is but a mockage to crave reformation, where ſuch like have place.</p>
               <p>And in ſo farre, as in the order taken at <hi>Leith,</hi> in the yeere of our Lord 1571, it appeares that ſuch may be admitted, being found qualified; either that pretended order is againſt all good order, or elſe it muſt be underſtood not of them that be qualified in worldly affaires, or to ſerve in Court, but ſuch as are qualified to teach Gods Word, having their lawfull admiſſion of the kirk.</p>
               <p>As to Biſhops, if the name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be properly taken, they are all one with the Miniſters, as before was declared. For it is not a name of ſuperiority and lordſhip, but of office and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe in the corruption of the kirk, this name (as others) have been abuſed, and yet is likely to be, we cannot allow the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe new choſen Biſhops, neither of the Chapiters that are Electors of them to ſuch offices, as they are choſen unto.</p>
               <p>True Biſhops ſhould addict themſelves to a particular flock, which ſundry of them refuſe, neither ſhould they uſurpe Lordſhip over their brethren, and over the inheritance of Chriſt, as theſe men doe.</p>
               <p>Paſtors, in ſo farre as they are Paſtors, have not the office of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of moe kirks joyned to the paſtorſhip, without it be given to them.</p>
               <p>It is a corruption, that Biſhops ſhould have further bounds to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nor they may lawfully.</p>
               <p>No man ought to have the office of Vifitation, but he that is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully choſen thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Elderſhips being well eſtabliſhed, have power to ſend out viſitours one or moe, with commiſſion to vifit the bounds within their Elderſhip, and likewiſe after count taken of them, either
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95701:57"/>continue them, or remove them from time to time, to the which El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips they ſhall be alwayes ſubject.</p>
               <p>Criminall juriſdiction in the perſon of a paſtor, is a corruption.</p>
               <p>It agreeth not with the word of God, that Biſhops ſhould be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of Paſtors, Paſtors of many flocks, and yet without a certaine flock, and without ordinary teaching.</p>
               <p>It agreeth not with the Scriptures, that they ſhould be exemed from the correction of their brethren, and Diſcipline of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Elderſhip of the Kirk, where they ſhall ſerve, neither that they uſurpe the Office of Viſitation of other Kirks, nor any other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction beſide other Miniſters, but ſo farre as ſhall be committed to them by the kirk.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we deſire the Biſhops that now are, either to agree to that order that Gods word requires in them, as the generall kirk will preſcribe unto them, not paſſing their bounds, either in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaſticall or Civill affaires, or elſe to be depoſed from all function in the kirk.</p>
               <p>We deny not in the meane time, but Miniſters may and ſhould affiſt their Princes when they are required, in all things agreeable to the Word, whether it be in Councell, or Parliament, or otherwayes; Providing alwayes, they neither neglect their own charges, nor through flattery of Princes hurt the publick eſtate of the Kirk.</p>
               <p>But generally, we ſay, no perſon under whatſoever title of the Kirk, and ſpecially the abuſed titles in Papiſtry, of Prelates, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and Chapters, ought to attempt any act in the Kirks name, either in Councell, or Parliament, or out of Councell, having no Commiſſion of the Reformed Kirk within this Realme.</p>
               <p>And by Act of Parliament it is provided, that the Papiſticall Kirk and Juriſdiction ſhould have no place within the ſame, and no Biſhop nor other Prelate in times comming ſhould uſe any juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction flowing from his authority.</p>
               <p>And againe, that no other Ecclefiaſticall Juriſdiction ſhould be acknowledged within this Realme, but that which is, and ſhall be in the Reformed Kirk, and flowing therfrom.</p>
               <p>So we eſteem holding of Chapiters in Papiſticall manner, either in Cathedrall kirks, Abbeyes, Colledges, or other conventuall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, uſurping the name and authority of the kirk, to hurt the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof, or uſe any other Act to the prejudice of the ſame, fince the yeare of our Lord 1560 yeares, to be abuſe and corruption, contrary to the liberty of the true kirk, and lawes of the Realme;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95701:57"/>and therefore ought to be annulled, reduced, and in times comming utterly diſcharged.</p>
               <p>The dependances alſo of the Papiſticall juriſdiction are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; of the which ſort is mingled juriſdiction of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, in ſo farre as they meddle with Eccleſiaſticall matters, and have no Commiſſion of the kirke thereto, but were elected in time of our Soveraignes mother, when things were out of order. It is an abſurd thing, that ſundry of them having no function of the kirk, ſhould be Judges to Miniſters, and depoſe them from their roomes. Therefore they either would be diſcharged to meddle with Eccleſiaſticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or it would be limited to them in what matters they might be Judges, and not hurt the liberty of the kirk.</p>
               <p>They alſo that before were of the Eccleſiaſtique eſtate in the Popes kirk, or that are admitted of new to the Papiſticall titles, and now are tollerate by the lawes of the Realme to poſſeſſe the two-part of their Eccleſiaſticall rents, ought not have any further liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but to intromet with the portion aſſigned and granted to them for their life-times; and not under the abuſed titles which they had to diſpon the kirk-rents, ſet tackes and fewes thereof at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure, to the great hurt of the kirk, and poore labourers that dwell upon the kirk-lands, contrary to all good conſcience and order.</p>

               <head>CHAP. <hi>XII. Certain ſpeciall heads of Reformation, which we crave.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHatſoever hath been ſpoken of the offices of the kirk, the ſeverall power of the office-bearers, their conjunct pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alſo, and laſt of the patrimrny of the kirk, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to be the right Reformation which God craves at our hands, that the kirk be ordered according thereto, as with that order which is moſt agreeable to the Word.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſomething would be touched in particular, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the eſtate of the Countrey, and that which we principally ſeek to be reformed in the ſame, we have collected them in theſe heads following.</p>
               <p>Seeing the whole Countrey is divided in Provinces, and thir Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces againe are divided in Pariſhes, as well in land-ward, as in Townes; in every Pariſh and reaſonable Congregation there would be placed one or moe Paſtors to feed the flock, and no Paſtor or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95701:58"/>Miniſter alwayes to be burdened with the particular charge of moe kirks or flocks then one alanerly.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it will be thought hard to finde out Paſtors or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to all the paroch kirks of the Realm, as well in Landward, as in Towns, we think by the advice of ſuch as commiſſion may be given to by the kirk and Prince, Pariſhes in landward or ſmall Villages, may be joyned two or three or more, in ſome places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the principall and meſt commodious kirks to ſtand, and be repaired ſufficiently, and qualified Miniſters placed thereat; and the other kirks, which are not found neceſſary, may be ſuffered to decay, their kirk-yards alwayes being kept for buriall places, and in ſome places where need requires, a Pariſh, where the Congregation is over great for one kirk, may be divided in twa or moe.</p>
               <p>Doctors would be appointed in Univerſities, Colledges, and in other places needfull, and ſufficiently provided for, to open up the meaning of the Scriptures, and to have the charge of Schooles, and teach the rudiments of Religion.</p>
               <p>As for Elders, there would be ſome to be cenſurers of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people, one or moe in every Congregation, but not an Aſſembly of Elders in every particular kirk, but onely in Towns, and famous places, where reſort of men of judgement and ability to that effect may be had, where the Elders of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar kirks about may convene together, and have a common El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, and aſſembly-place among them, to treat of all things that concerns the Congregations of which they have the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.</p>
               <p>And as there ought to be men appointed to unite and divide the Pariſhes, as neceſſity and commodity requires: So would there be appointed by the generall kirk, with aſſent of the Prince, ſuch men as feare God, and know the eſtate of the Countries, that were able to nominate and deſigne the places, where the particular El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips ſhould convene, taking confideration of the Dioceſſe, as they were divided of old, and of the eſtate of the Countries, and Provinces of the Realm.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe concerning Provinciall and Synodall Aſſemblies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideration were eaſie to be taken: How many and in what places they were to be holden, and how oft they ſhould convene, ought to be referred to the liberty of the generall kirk, and order to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:95701:58"/>
The Nationall Aſſemblies of this Countrey, called commonly the Generall Aſſemblies, ought alwayes to be reteined in their own liberty, and have their owne place.</p>
               <p>With power to the kirk to appoint times and places convenient for the ſame, and all men, as well Magiſtrates, as inferiours to be ſubject to the judgement of the ſame in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, without any reclamation or appellation to any Judge, Civill or Eccleſiaſticall within the Realm.</p>
               <p>The liberty of the election of perſons called to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call function, and obſerved without interruption, ſo long as the kirk was not corrupted by Antichriſt, we deſire to be reſtored and retained within this Realm.</p>
               <p>So that none be intruſed upon any Congregation, either by the Prince, or any inferiour perſon, without lawfull election, and the aſſent of the people over whom the perſon is placed, as the practiſe of the Apoſtolicall and Primitive Kirk, and good order craves.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this order, which Gods word craves, cannot ſtand with pat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ronages and preſentation to benefices uſed in the Popes kirk, we deſire all them, that truely feare God, earneſtly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that for as much as the names of patronages and benefices, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the effect thereof, have flowed from the Pope, and corruption of the Canon law onely, in ſo farre as thereby any perſon was intruſed or placed over Kirkes having <hi>Curam ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for as much as that manner of proceeding hath no ground in the word of God, but is contrary to the ſame, and to the ſaid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Election, they ought not now to have place in this light of Reformation. And therefore, whoſoever will embrace Gods word, and deſire the kingdome of his Son Chriſt Jeſus to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, they will alſo embrace, and receive that policie and order which the word of God, and upright eſtate of his Kirk craves, otherwiſe it is in vaine that they have profeſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding as concerning other patronages of benefices that have not <hi>curam animarum,</hi> as they ſpeak: ſuch as are chaplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, prebendaries founded upon temporall lands, annuels, and ſuch like, may be reſerved unto the ancient Patrones, to diſpone here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, when they vaike, to ſchollers and burſers, as they are required by act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>As for the Kirk rents in generall we deſire that order be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and maintained amongſt us, that may ſtand with the ſincerity
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95701:59"/>of Gods word, and practiſe of the purity of the Kirk of Chriſt:</p>
               <p>To wit, that, as was before ſpoken, the whole rent and patrimony of the Kirk, excepting the ſmall patronages before mentioned, may be divided in foure portions: one thereof to be aſſigned to the Paſtor for his entertainment, and hoſpitality; an other to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Deacons and other officers of the Kirk, ſuch as clerks of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, takers up of the Pſalmes, Beadels and keepers of the Kirk, ſo far as is neceſſary: Joyning with them alſo the Doctors, and Schooles, to help the ancient foundations where need requires: the third portion to be beſtowed upon the poore members of the faithfull, and hoſpitalls: the fourth for reparation of the Kirks, and other extraordinary charges as are profitable for the Kirk, and alſo for the common-wealth, if need require.</p>
               <p>We deſire therefore the Eccleſiaſticall goods to be uplifted and diſtributed faithfully to whom they appertaine, and that by the miniſterie of the Deacons, to whoſe office properly the collection and diſtribution thereof belongs, that the poore may be anſweted of their portion thereof, and they of the Miniſtery live without care and ſolicitude: as alſo the reſt of the treaſury of the Kirk may be reſerved, and beſtowed to their right uſes.</p>
               <p>If theſe Deacons be elected with ſuch qualities as Gods word craves to be in them, there is no feare, that they ſhall abuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their office, as the profane Collector did of before.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe this vocation appeares to many to be dangerous, let them be obliſhed, as they were of old, to a yearely count to the Paſtors and Elderſhip; and if the Kirk and Prince think expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, let cautioners be obliſhed for their fidelity, that the Kirk rents on na wayes be dilapidat.</p>
               <p>And to the effect this order may take place, it is to be provided that all other intrometters with the Kirk rent, Collectors generall or ſpeciall, whether it be by appointment of the Prince, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, may be denuded of further intromiſſion therewith, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Kirk rents in time comming to be wholly intrometted with by the miniſtrie of the Deacons, and diſtribute to the uſe before mentioned.</p>
               <p>And alſo, to the effect that the Eccleſiaſticall rents may ſuffice to theſe uſes for the which they are to be appointed, Wee thinke it neceſſary to be deſired, that all alienations, ſetting of fewes, or tacks of the rents of the Kirk, as well lands as tiends, in hurt and diminution of the old rentalls, be reduced and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95701:59"/>and the patrimony of the of Kirk reſtored to the former old liberty.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe, that in times comming the tiends be ſet to nane, but to the labourers of the ground, or elſe not ſet at all, as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, and ſubſcribed by the Nobility of before.</p>

               <p>SEeing the end of this ſpirituall government and policie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeak, is, that God may be glorified, the kingdome of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt advanced, and all who are of his myſticall body may live peaceable in conſcience; Therfore we dare boldly affirme, that all theſe who have true reſpect to theſe ends, will even for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cauſe gladly agree and conforme themſelves to this order, and advance the ſame, ſo farre as lyeth in them, that their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being ſet at reſt, they may be repleniſhed with ſpiritual glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in giving full obedience to that which Gods word, and the teſtimony of their owne conſcience doth crave, and refuſing all corruption contrary to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Next wee ſhall become an example and paterne of good and godly order to other nations, countries, and Kirks profeſſing the ſame Religion with us, that as they have glorified God in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the ſincerity of the word hither to, without any errours, praiſe be to his name: ſo they may have the like occaſion in our converſation, when as we conforme our ſelves to that diſcipline, policie, and good order, which the ſame word, and purity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation craveth at our hands: Otherwiſe that fearfull ſentence may be juſtly ſaid to us, <hi>The ſervant knowing the will of his Maſter, and not doing it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if we have any piety or reſpect to the poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſo greatly increaſe and multiply amongſt us, we will not ſuffer them to be longer defrauded of that part of the patrimony of the Kirk, which juſtly belongs unto them; and by this order, if it be duly put to execution, the burden of them ſhall bee taken off us to our great comfort, the ſtreets ſhall be cleanſed of the cryings and murmurings of them as we ſhall no more be any ſcandall to other Nations, as we have hitherto been, for not taking order with the poore amongſt us, and cauſing the word which we profeſſe to be evill ſpoken of, giving occaſion of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95701:60"/>ſlander to the enemies, and offending the conſciences of the ſimple and godly.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, it ſhall be a great eaſe and commodity to the whole common people, in relieving them of the building and upholding their Kirks, in bigging of brigges, and other like publick workes: to the labourers of the ground in payment of their tiends, and ſhortly in all theſe things, whereinto they have been hitherto ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly handled by them that were falſly called Kirk-men, their tackſ-men, factours, chalmerlanes and extortioners.</p>
               <p>Finally, to the Kings Majeſtie, and common-wealth of the countrey this profit ſhall redound, That the other affaires of the Kirk being ſufficiently provided, according to the diſtribution, of the which hath been ſpoken; the ſuperplus being collected in the treaſurie of the Kirk may be profitably imployed, and liberally beſtowed upon the extraordinary ſupport of the affaires of the Prince and Common-wealth, and ſpecially of that part which is appointed for reparation of Kirks.</p>
               <p>So to conclude, all being willing to apply themſelves to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the people ſuffering themſelves to be ruled according thereto: the Princes and Magiſtrates not being exemed, and theſe that are placed in the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate rightly ruling and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, God ſhall be glorified, the Kirk edified, and the bounds thereof inlarged, Chriſt Jeſus and his Kingdome ſet up, Satan and his Kingdome ſubverted, and God ſhall dwell in the midſt of us, to our comfort, through Jeſus Chriſt, who together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt, abides bleſſed in all eternity, <hi>Amen.</hi>
